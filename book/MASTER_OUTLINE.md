# The Octonionic Rewrite: A Complete Mathematical Framework for Unified Systems

## Purpose
This book establishes a new field of mathematics rooted in 7D octonionic non-associative algebra that:
1. Recovers ALL existing 3D/4D physics and engineering as projections (subalgebra slices)
2. Resolves anomalies where 3D frameworks fail (red shift, quantum non-locality, matter-antimatter asymmetry, gravitational wave discrepancies)
3. Extends mathematical expressiveness to uncountable contextual dimensions via decompactified PBW bases
4. Enables unified modeling of complex systems (engineering + markets + politics + supply chains) without reductionist pruning
5. Provides a complete, self-consistent axiomatic system from which an AI can derive new equations and tools

## Core Principles
- Non-associativity is ontological: (a × b) × c ≠ a × (b × c) reflects hierarchical reality
- Expressions carry realistic dimensionality: any number/equation holds uncountable derivable context layers
- The Killing form decompactifies: B(X,Y) = ∫ tr(ad_X^{(i)} ad_Y^{(j)}) dμ over uncountable measures
- PBW extends to non-associative universal enveloping algebras via Sabinin/Malcev structures
- 3D is a faithful but incomplete projection — everything valid in 3D remains valid, plus more
- The associator [a,b,c] = (ab)c - a(bc) is not an error term — it IS the contextual information
