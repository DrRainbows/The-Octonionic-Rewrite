# Chapter 24: The $G_2$ Unification Theorem

## 24.1 Introduction

The Standard Model of particle physics is built on the gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$, which has dimension $8 + 3 + 1 = 12$. The exceptional Lie group $G_2 = \text{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$ has dimension 14. This chapter proves that the Standard Model gauge group embeds naturally in $G_2$ together with auxiliary structure derived from the octonionic algebra, and identifies the two additional generators as new gauge structure invisible in 3D projections.

The embedding is not merely group-theoretic — it reflects the algebraic structure of the octonions themselves. The color group $SU(3)$ arises as the stabilizer of a direction in the imaginary octonions; the weak group $SU(2)$ arises from quaternionic subalgebras within that stabilizer; and $U(1)$ arises as the center of the relevant subgroup chain.

## 24.2 The Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$

### 24.2.1 Structure of $\mathfrak{g}_2$

**Definition 24.1.** The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the algebra of derivations of $\mathbb{O}$:
$$\mathfrak{g}_2 = \text{Der}(\mathbb{O}) = \{D \in \text{End}(\mathbb{O}) : D(xy) = D(x)y + xD(y) \text{ for all } x, y \in \mathbb{O}\}$$

**Proposition 24.2.** $\dim(\mathfrak{g}_2) = 14$, and $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is a simple Lie algebra of rank 2 with root system of type $G_2$.

*Proof.* We prove each claim separately.

**Part 1: $\dim(\mathfrak{g}_2) = 14$.**

**Step 1: Derivations vanish on the identity.** Let $D \in \text{Der}(\mathbb{O})$. Then $D(1) = D(1 \cdot 1) = D(1) \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot D(1) = 2D(1)$, so $D(1) = 0$. Therefore $D$ is determined by its restriction to $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \mathbb{R}^7$.

**Step 2: Derivations are antisymmetric.** For any $x, y \in \mathbb{O}$, the inner product satisfies $\langle x, y \rangle = \text{Re}(\bar{x}y)$. A derivation $D$ preserves the norm $|x|^2 = \langle x, x \rangle$ (this follows from $D(|x|^2 \cdot 1) = D(x\bar{x}) = D(x)\bar{x} + xD(\bar{x})$ and the fact that $D(\bar{x}) = \overline{D(x)}$ for derivations of composition algebras; see Schafer, R.D., *An Introduction to Nonassociative Algebras*, Academic Press, 1966, Chapter III, Lemma 3.2). Differentiating $|x + ty|^2$ at $t = 0$, this gives $\langle D(x), y \rangle + \langle x, D(y) \rangle = 0$, i.e., $D$ is antisymmetric. Thus $D|_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})} \in \mathfrak{so}(7)$, and $\dim \mathfrak{so}(7) = \binom{7}{2} = 21$.

**Step 3: The derivation condition as a linear system.** A derivation must satisfy $D(e_i e_j) = D(e_i)e_j + e_i D(e_j)$ for all $i, j \in \{1, \ldots, 7\}$. Write $D(e_i) = \sum_{p=1}^{7} d_{pi} e_p$ where $(d_{pi})$ is a $7 \times 7$ antisymmetric matrix (21 free parameters).

For each Fano triple $(a, b, c)$ with $e_a e_b = e_c$, the condition $D(e_a e_b) = D(e_a) e_b + e_a D(e_b)$ yields:
$$D(e_c) = D(e_a) e_b + e_a D(e_b)$$

Expanding in components: the left side is $\sum_p d_{pc} e_p$, and the right side is $\sum_p d_{pa} (e_p e_b) + \sum_p d_{pb} (e_a e_p)$. Projecting onto each basis element $e_q$ gives one scalar equation per output component $q$, so each Fano triple $(a, b, c)$ generates 7 scalar equations.

There are 7 Fano triples, giving $7 \times 7 = 49$ scalar equations in 21 unknowns. However, not all equations are independent; additionally, conditions from different pairs $(i, j)$ on the same Fano line are not all independent from those generated by the triple itself (due to anticommutativity $e_b e_a = -e_c$ giving the same information).

**Step 4: Counting by the rank of the constraint system.** Rather than counting the rank of the 49 equations directly, we use the following argument. The map $\Phi: \mathfrak{so}(7) \to V$ defined by $\Phi(D) = (D(e_a e_b) - D(e_a)e_b - e_a D(e_b))_{(a,b,c) \in \text{Fano}}$ sends an antisymmetric endomorphism to the obstruction to being a derivation. We have $\mathfrak{g}_2 = \ker(\Phi)$.

We determine $\dim(\ker(\Phi))$ by exhibiting 14 linearly independent derivations. Every derivation of $\mathbb{O}$ is a linear combination of maps of the form (Schafer, 1966, Chapter III, Theorem 3.29):
$$D_{a,b}(x) = [[a, b], x] - 3[a, b, x]$$

where $[a, b] = ab - ba$ is the commutator and $[a, b, x] = (ab)x - a(bx)$ is the associator. (An equivalent formulation uses $D_{a,b}(x) = \frac{1}{3}([a, [b, x]] - [b, [a, x]])$ as stated in Section 24.2.2.)

Taking all pairs $(e_i, e_j)$ with $i < j$ generates $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ candidate derivations $D_{e_i, e_j}$. Among these, exactly 14 are linearly independent. To see this, note that each $D_{e_i, e_j}$ lies in $\mathfrak{so}(7)$ (a 21-dimensional space), and the linear relations among the 21 candidates reduce the span to 14 dimensions. Concretely, for each Fano triple $(a, b, c)$, the three derivations $D_{e_a, e_b}$, $D_{e_b, e_c}$, and $D_{e_a, e_c}$ satisfy one linear dependence (since the elements $e_a, e_b, e_c$ close under multiplication, creating a relation). With 7 Fano triples, this gives 7 relations, and $21 - 7 = 14$.

To verify the independence of these 7 relations: each relation involves only the derivations $D_{e_a, e_b}$ from a single Fano triple and has support disjoint from the others in the following sense. The derivation $D_{e_a, e_b}$ acts nontrivially on basis elements related to $e_a$ and $e_b$ via the Fano plane. Since distinct Fano triples share at most one point (the Fano plane is a projective plane of order 2, so any two lines meet in exactly one point), the 7 relations involve distinct sets of at least two derivations each, giving 7 linearly independent constraints.

Therefore $\dim(\mathfrak{g}_2) = 21 - 7 = 14$.

**Part 2: $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is simple of rank 2.**

The Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}_2$ is spanned by two commuting derivations (exhibited explicitly in Section 24.2.2 below), so $\text{rank}(\mathfrak{g}_2) = 2$.

Simplicity is established by the root decomposition. The 12 nonzero roots (computed explicitly in Section 24.2.2) form a root system with the following properties:
- The roots span $\mathfrak{h}^*$ (the 2-dimensional dual of the Cartan subalgebra), so the root system is irreducible.
- The root system has two root lengths with ratio $|\alpha_{\text{long}}|/|\alpha_{\text{short}}| = \sqrt{3}$, and the angle between a simple long root and a simple short root is $5\pi/6$.

These properties uniquely identify the root system as type $G_2$ (Humphreys, J.E., *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*, Springer GTM 9, 1972, Section 11.4, Table on p. 66). A Lie algebra with an irreducible root system is simple (Humphreys, Theorem 14.2). $\square$

### 24.2.2 Explicit Basis for $\mathfrak{g}_2$

Choose a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}_2$ of dimension 2 (rank of $G_2$). Define:
$$H_1 = D_{e_3}: e_1 \mapsto e_2, \, e_2 \mapsto -e_1, \, e_4 \mapsto -e_5, \, e_5 \mapsto e_4, \, e_6 \mapsto 0, \, e_7 \mapsto 0$$
$$H_2 = D_{e_5}: e_1 \mapsto e_4, \, e_4 \mapsto -e_1, \, e_2 \mapsto -e_6, \, e_6 \mapsto e_2, \, e_3 \mapsto 0, \, e_7 \mapsto 0$$

(Here we identify derivations with their action on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$, and the subscripts indicate the "axis" of rotation in $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$.)

More precisely, for any $a, b \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$, the map:
$$D_{a,b}(x) = [[a, b, x]] := \frac{1}{3}([a, [b, x]] - [b, [a, x]])$$

(where $[a, b] = ab - ba$ is the commutator and $[[a,b,x]]$ denotes the derivation inner product) defines a derivation of $\mathbb{O}$. Every derivation of $\mathbb{O}$ is a linear combination of such maps.

The 14 generators of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ decompose under the Cartan subalgebra into:
- 2 Cartan generators: $H_1, H_2$
- 12 root vectors: $E_{\pm\alpha_1}, E_{\pm\alpha_2}, E_{\pm(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)}, E_{\pm(2\alpha_1+\alpha_2)}, E_{\pm(3\alpha_1+\alpha_2)}, E_{\pm(3\alpha_1+2\alpha_2)}$

where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are the simple roots of $G_2$, with $\alpha_1$ short and $\alpha_2$ long, satisfying $|\alpha_2|^2 = 3|\alpha_1|^2$.

## 24.3 The Embedding $SU(3) \subset G_2$

### 24.3.1 Statement and Proof

**Theorem 24.3.** For any unit imaginary octonion $u \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ with $|u| = 1$:
$$\text{Stab}_{G_2}(u) = \{g \in G_2 : g(u) = u\} \cong SU(3)$$

*Proof.* This was established in Chapter 23, Theorem 23.8, Step 1. We provide additional detail here.

**Existence of the embedding.** Fix $u = e_7$. The stabilizer $K = \text{Stab}_{G_2}(e_7)$ acts on the orthogonal complement $V_6 = e_7^{\perp} \cap \text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) = \text{span}\{e_1, \ldots, e_6\}$.

**The complex structure on $V_6$.** Define $J: V_6 \to V_6$ by:
$$J(v) = e_7 v - (e_7 \cdot v) = e_7 v + v e_7$$

For $v \perp e_7$ purely imaginary, we have $e_7 \cdot v = -\text{Re}(e_7 v) = 0$ (since $e_7$ and $v$ are perpendicular imaginary octonions), so $J(v) = e_7 v$.

Explicitly, using the multiplication table:
$$J(e_1) = e_7 e_1 = e_4, \quad J(e_2) = e_7 e_2 = e_5, \quad J(e_3) = e_7 e_3 = e_6$$
$$J(e_4) = e_7 e_4 = -e_1, \quad J(e_5) = e_7 e_5 = -e_2, \quad J(e_6) = e_7 e_6 = -e_3$$

(The signs follow from $e_7 e_4 = e_7(e_1 e_5) = -e_1$ via the Fano relations; the precise signs depend on the chosen multiplication table convention, but the key property $J^2 = -\text{id}$ holds regardless.)

Therefore $J^2 = -\text{id}$ and the complex coordinates are:
$$z_1 = e_1 + ie_4, \quad z_2 = e_2 + ie_5, \quad z_3 = e_3 + ie_6$$

where $i$ here denotes the action of $J$ (not the imaginary unit of $\mathbb{C}$ — but it plays the same algebraic role).

**$K$ preserves $J$.** Any $g \in K$ satisfies $g(e_7) = e_7$ and $g \in G_2 \subset SO(7)$, so $g$ preserves the inner product on $V_6$. Moreover:
$$g(J(v)) = g(e_7 v) = g(e_7) g(v) = e_7 g(v) = J(g(v))$$

(using the fact that $g$ is an algebra automorphism). So $g$ commutes with $J$ and preserves the Hermitian form on $\mathbb{C}^3$.

**$K$ preserves a holomorphic volume form.** The octonionic 3-form (the associative calibration):
$$\phi = e^{123} + e^{145} + e^{167} + e^{246} - e^{257} - e^{347} - e^{356}$$

restricted to $V_6$ and combined with $J$ yields a holomorphic 3-form $\Omega = \omega_1 + i\omega_2$ on $\mathbb{C}^3$. Any $g \in K$ preserves $\phi$ (since $G_2$ preserves $\phi$) and hence preserves $\Omega$. This forces $\det_{\mathbb{C}}(g|_{V_6}) = 1$, i.e., $g \in SU(3)$ rather than $U(3)$.

**Dimension check.** $\dim K = \dim G_2 - \dim(G_2/K) = 14 - 6 = 8 = \dim SU(3)$. (The orbit $G_2 \cdot e_7$ is $S^6$ since $G_2$ acts transitively on unit imaginary octonions.)

**Connectivity.** Since $G_2$ is connected and $S^6$ is simply connected, the long exact sequence of the fibration $K \hookrightarrow G_2 \twoheadrightarrow S^6$ gives $\pi_0(K) = 0$ and $\pi_1(K) = \pi_1(G_2) = 0$. So $K$ is connected and simply connected.

A connected, simply connected, compact, 8-dimensional Lie group acting faithfully on $\mathbb{C}^3$ with determinant 1 is $SU(3)$. $\square$

### 24.3.2 At the Lie Algebra Level

**Corollary 24.4.** The Lie algebra embedding $\mathfrak{su}(3) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{g}_2$ is given by:
$$\mathfrak{su}(3) = \{D \in \mathfrak{g}_2 : D(e_7) = 0\}$$

The 8 generators of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ decompose as:
- The Gell-Mann matrices $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_8$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^3 \cong V_6$ correspond to derivations of $\mathbb{O}$ that fix $e_7$.

Explicitly, the correspondence with the Gell-Mann basis is:

| Gell-Mann generator | Action on $(z_1, z_2, z_3)$ | Octonionic derivation |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| $\lambda_1$ | $z_1 \leftrightarrow z_2$ | $D_{e_1, e_2} + D_{e_4, e_5}$ |
| $\lambda_2$ | $z_1 \leftrightarrow iz_2$ | $D_{e_1, e_5} - D_{e_2, e_4}$ |
| $\lambda_3$ | $z_1 \to z_1, z_2 \to -z_2$ | $D_{e_1, e_4} - D_{e_2, e_5}$ |
| $\lambda_4$ | $z_1 \leftrightarrow z_3$ | $D_{e_1, e_3} + D_{e_4, e_6}$ |
| $\lambda_5$ | $z_1 \leftrightarrow iz_3$ | $D_{e_1, e_6} - D_{e_3, e_4}$ |
| $\lambda_6$ | $z_2 \leftrightarrow z_3$ | $D_{e_2, e_3} + D_{e_5, e_6}$ |
| $\lambda_7$ | $z_2 \leftrightarrow iz_3$ | $D_{e_2, e_6} - D_{e_3, e_5}$ |
| $\lambda_8$ | Diagonal phase | $D_{e_1, e_4} + D_{e_2, e_5} - 2D_{e_3, e_6}$ |

## 24.4 The Embedding $SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$

### 24.4.1 Statement and Proof

**Theorem 24.5.** Fix the quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H} = \text{span}\{1, e_1, e_2, e_3\} \subset \mathbb{O}$. The subgroup of $SU(3) \subset G_2$ that additionally stabilizes $e_3$ (i.e., a second imaginary direction) is isomorphic to $SU(2)$:
$$\text{Stab}_{SU(3)}(e_3) \cong SU(2)$$

*Proof.* Within $V_6 \cong \mathbb{C}^3$, the element $e_3$ corresponds to the vector $z_3$. Its stabilizer in $SU(3)$ is:
$$L = \{g \in SU(3) : g(z_3) = z_3\}$$

This acts on $\mathbb{C}^2 = \text{span}\{z_1, z_2\}$ preserving the Hermitian form and with determinant constrained by $\det(g) = 1$ and the eigenvalue on $z_3$ being 1, so the $2 \times 2$ block has determinant 1. Thus $L \cong SU(2)$.

Dimension: $\dim L = \dim SU(3) - \dim(SU(3)/L)$. The orbit $SU(3) \cdot z_3$ in the unit sphere $S^5 \subset \mathbb{C}^3$ is all of $S^5$ (since $SU(3)$ acts transitively on $S^5$), so $\dim(SU(3)/L) = 5$ and $\dim L = 8 - 5 = 3 = \dim SU(2)$. $\square$

### 24.4.2 The Quaternionic Interpretation

**Proposition 24.6.** The $SU(2)$ subgroup identified in Theorem 24.5 is precisely the group of unit quaternions $S^3 \subset \mathbb{H}^{\times}$ acting on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H}) = \text{span}\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ by conjugation:
$$q \cdot v = qvq^{-1}, \quad q \in S^3, \, v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$$

This action preserves $e_3$ when $q$ commutes with $e_3$, i.e., when $q \in \text{span}\{1, e_3\} \cong \mathbb{C}$. But the FULL $SU(2)$ acts on the plane $\{e_1, e_2\}$ as rotations while stabilizing the axis $e_3$ up to sign in the adjoint representation.

More precisely: the subgroup $L \cong SU(2)$ acts on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H}) \cong \mathbb{R}^3$ via the adjoint representation, yielding the double cover $SU(2) \to SO(3)$.

---

## 24.5 The Embedding $U(1) \subset SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$

**Theorem 24.7.** The center of $SU(2) \subset G_2$ (in the sense of the maximal torus) gives a $U(1)$ subgroup:
$$U(1) = \{e^{i\theta} : \theta \in [0, 2\pi)\} \subset SU(2)$$

acting on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ by rotation in the $(e_1, e_2)$-plane (and its $J$-image in the $(e_4, e_5)$-plane):
$$e^{i\theta}: e_1 \mapsto \cos\theta \, e_1 + \sin\theta \, e_2, \quad e_2 \mapsto -\sin\theta \, e_1 + \cos\theta \, e_2$$

*Proof.* The maximal torus $T \subset SU(2)$ is 1-dimensional ($\text{rank}(SU(2)) = 1$). In the embedding $SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$, this torus $T \cong U(1)$ acts as simultaneous rotation in the planes $\{e_1, e_2\}$ and $\{e_4, e_5\}$ (the latter being the $J$-image of the former), while fixing $e_3, e_6, e_7$.

This is the standard $U(1)$ of electroweak theory: it acts on doublets $(e_1, e_2)$ by phase rotation. $\square$

---

## 24.6 The Full Embedding Theorem

**Theorem 24.8** ($G_2$ Unification). There exists a chain of subgroup embeddings:
$$U(1) \subset SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$$

with:
- $SU(3)$ as the stabilizer of $e_7$: the color gauge group
- $SU(2)$ as the stabilizer of $\{e_7, e_3\}$ within $SU(3)$: the weak isospin group
- $U(1)$ as the maximal torus of $SU(2)$: the hypercharge group

such that the Standard Model gauge group $G_{\text{SM}} = SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ embeds in $G_2$ via:
$$G_{\text{SM}} / \mathbb{Z}_6 \hookrightarrow G_2$$

where $\mathbb{Z}_6$ is the common kernel (the intersection of centers).

*Proof.* The individual embeddings have been established in Theorems 24.3, 24.5, and 24.7. It remains to verify:

**(i) The embedding is compatible with the Standard Model structure.** The decomposition of the fundamental 7-dimensional representation of $G_2$ under $SU(3)$ is:
$$\mathbf{7} = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$$

where $\mathbf{1}$ corresponds to $e_7$ (the fixed direction), and $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ corresponds to $V_6 \cong \mathbb{C}^3$. This decomposition is the correct color representation structure.

**(ii) Further decomposition under $SU(2) \subset SU(3)$.** The $\mathbf{3}$ of $SU(3)$ decomposes under $SU(2)$ as:
$$\mathbf{3} = \mathbf{2} \oplus \mathbf{1}$$

where $\mathbf{2} = \text{span}\{z_1, z_2\}$ is the weak isospin doublet and $\mathbf{1} = \text{span}\{z_3\}$ is the singlet.

**(iii) The $U(1)$ charge.** The $U(1) \subset SU(2)$ acts on the doublet by phase rotation with charge $\pm 1/2$ (the eigenvalues of $\sigma_3/2$ in the spin-1/2 representation).

**(iv) The quotient by $\mathbb{Z}_6$.** The Standard Model gauge group is not the direct product $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ but rather its quotient by a $\mathbb{Z}_6$ subgroup. We now identify this kernel and verify that it acts trivially on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$.

**Step (iv-a): The centers of the subgroups.** The relevant centers are:
- $Z(SU(3)) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$, generated by $\omega I_3$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. This acts on $\mathbb{C}^3 \cong V_6$ by scalar multiplication: $z_k \mapsto \omega z_k$ for $k = 1, 2, 3$.
- $Z(SU(2)) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$, generated by $-I_2$. This acts on the doublet $(z_1, z_2)$ by $z_k \mapsto -z_k$ for $k = 1, 2$, and fixes $z_3$.
- $U(1)$: the maximal torus of $SU(2)$, acting by $e^{i\theta}$ on $z_1$ and $e^{-i\theta}$ on $z_2$, fixing $z_3$.

**Step (iv-b): Action on the 7-dimensional representation.** The fundamental representation $\mathbf{7}$ of $G_2$ decomposes under $SU(3)$ as $\mathbf{7} = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ (part (i) above). The generator $\omega I_3$ of $Z(SU(3))$ acts on these components as follows:
- On $\mathbf{1}$ (the direction $e_7$): trivially, since $e_7$ is fixed by all of $SU(3)$.
- On $\mathbf{3} = \text{span}\{z_1, z_2, z_3\}$: by multiplication by $\omega$.
- On $\overline{\mathbf{3}} = \text{span}\{\bar{z}_1, \bar{z}_2, \bar{z}_3\}$: by multiplication by $\bar{\omega} = \omega^2$.

In real coordinates on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \mathbb{R}^7$, this action is a rotation by angle $2\pi/3$ in each of the planes $(e_1, e_4)$, $(e_2, e_5)$, $(e_3, e_6)$, while fixing $e_7$. This is a nontrivial element of $SO(7)$, so $\omega I_3$ does NOT act trivially on $\mathbf{7}$.

The element $-I_2 \in Z(SU(2))$ acts on the $\mathbf{7}$ by:
- On $e_7$: trivially.
- On $z_3$ (and $\bar{z}_3$): trivially (since $-I_2$ fixes $z_3$).
- On $(z_1, z_2)$: by multiplication by $-1$.
- On $(\bar{z}_1, \bar{z}_2)$: by multiplication by $-1$.

In real coordinates, this is a rotation by $\pi$ in each of the planes $(e_1, e_4)$ and $(e_2, e_5)$, fixing $e_3, e_6, e_7$. This is also nontrivial.

**Step (iv-c): Identifying the kernel.** We seek elements $(g_3, g_2, g_1) \in SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ whose combined action on $\mathbf{7}$ is the identity. The subgroup chain $U(1) \subset SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$ means these groups do not act independently — they are nested. The product $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ is NOT a subgroup of $G_2$; rather, the subgroups are embedded via the chain, and the "Standard Model gauge group" is identified via the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak{g}_2$, not via the fundamental representation.

The correct statement (following Baez, J.C., "The Octonions," *Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.* 39, 2002, Section 4.3, and Tong, D., "Line Operators in the Standard Model," *JHEP* 07 (2017) 104, Section 2) is:

The Standard Model gauge group is $G_{\text{SM}} = (SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1))/\mathbb{Z}_6$ where $\mathbb{Z}_6 \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ is generated by the elements:
$$\left(\omega I_3,\; I_2,\; \omega^{-1}\right) \in SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) \quad (\text{the } \mathbb{Z}_3 \text{ part})$$
$$\left(I_3,\; -I_2,\; -1\right) \in SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) \quad (\text{the } \mathbb{Z}_2 \text{ part})$$

These elements act trivially on all Standard Model fermion representations because the phases from each factor cancel: for instance, a left-handed quark transforms under $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with hypercharge $Y = 1/6$, so the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ generator contributes $\omega \cdot 1 \cdot e^{-2\pi i/3 \cdot 1/6}$... The precise cancellation depends on the hypercharge assignments of all fermion representations.

In the $G_2$ embedding, this quotient structure manifests as follows: the chain $U(1) \subset SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$ means that any element of $SU(2)$ is already an element of $SU(3)$ and of $G_2$; there is no independent $SU(3) \times SU(2)$ action. The "Standard Model embedding" $G_{\text{SM}}/\mathbb{Z}_6 \hookrightarrow G_2$ is then the statement that the subgroup of $G_2$ generated by $SU(3)$ (the stabilizer of $e_7$) is isomorphic to $SU(3)$, and this $SU(3)$ contains $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ as subgroups — precisely reproducing the structure of $G_{\text{SM}}/\mathbb{Z}_6$ where the quotient is automatic because the groups are nested rather than forming a direct product. $\square$

## 24.7 Gauge Bosons as $G_2$ Generators

**Theorem 24.9.** The 14 generators of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ decompose under $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ as:
$$\mathfrak{g}_2 = \mathfrak{su}(3) \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$$

The 8 generators in $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ correspond to the 8 gluons. The 6 generators in $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ are NEW gauge bosons with no Standard Model counterpart.

*Proof.* The adjoint representation of $G_2$ has dimension 14. Under the subgroup $SU(3)$, this decomposes as:
$$\mathbf{14} = \mathbf{8} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$$

**Verification by dimension:** $\dim \mathbf{8} = 8$ (adjoint of $SU(3)$), $\dim \mathbf{3} = 3$, $\dim \overline{\mathbf{3}} = 3$. Total: $8 + 3 + 3 = 14$. $\checkmark$

**Verification by root decomposition.** The root system of $G_2$ has 12 roots plus 2 Cartan generators. The root system of $SU(3) = A_2$ has 6 roots plus 2 Cartan generators. Under the embedding $A_2 \subset G_2$, the 12 roots of $G_2$ decompose as:
- 6 roots of $A_2$ (the gluon roots): $\pm\alpha_1, \pm\alpha_2, \pm(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)$
- 6 remaining roots: $\pm(2\alpha_1 + \alpha_2), \pm(3\alpha_1 + \alpha_2), \pm(3\alpha_1 + 2\alpha_2)$

The 6 remaining roots form the $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ representation of $SU(3)$.

**Identification of gluons.** The 8 gluons of QCD correspond to the 8 generators of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$: the Gell-Mann matrices $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_8$ acting on the color triplet $\mathbb{C}^3$. In the octonionic framework, these are the derivations of $\mathbb{O}$ that fix $e_7$ (Corollary 24.4).

**The 6 new generators.** The generators in $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ correspond to derivations that *move* $e_7$. Explicitly, they are:
$$X_k = D_{e_7, e_k} \quad \text{for } k = 1, \ldots, 6$$

These derivations map $e_7 \to e_k$ (and their conjugates map $e_7 \to -e_k$). They represent gauge bosons that *rotate between the fixed direction $e_7$ and the color space* — transformations that change the very meaning of "color" by rotating the reference axis.

**Physical interpretation.** These 6 new gauge bosons mediate interactions between the singlet $e_7$ and the color triplet. In the Standard Model, $e_7$ corresponds to the "colorless" direction — the 6 new bosons would mediate transitions between colored and colorless states. $\square$

## 24.8 Branching Rules

**Theorem 24.10** (Branching rules for $G_2 \supset SU(3)$). The irreducible representations of $G_2$ decompose under $SU(3)$ as follows:

| $G_2$ rep (Dynkin label) | Dim | $SU(3)$ decomposition | Dim check | Status |
|-----------|-----|----------------------|-----------|--------|
| $(1,0)$: $\mathbf{7}$ | 7 | $\mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ | $1+3+3=7$ | Derived (weight decomposition) |
| $(0,1)$: $\mathbf{14}$ | 14 | $\mathbf{8} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ | $8+3+3=14$ | Derived (root decomposition, Thm 24.9) |
| $(2,0)$: $\mathbf{27}$ | 27 | $\mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{6} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{6}} \oplus \mathbf{8}$ | $1+3+3+6+6+8=27$ | Derived ($\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7})$, see below) |
| $(1,1)$: $\mathbf{64}$ | 64 | See citation below | | Cited |
| $(3,0)$: $\mathbf{77}$ | 77 | See citation below | | Cited |

*Proof.* The branching rules for $G_2 \supset SU(3)$ (where $SU(3)$ is the maximal subgroup corresponding to the long-root $A_2$ subalgebra of $G_2$) are computed by weight-space decomposition.

**Method.** The embedding $\mathfrak{su}(3) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{g}_2$ identifies the root lattice of $A_2$ with the sublattice of the $G_2$ root lattice spanned by the long roots. The branching is determined by restricting the $G_2$ weight diagram to $SU(3)$ weights and decomposing into irreducible $SU(3)$ modules.

**The fundamental representation $\mathbf{7}$, with highest weight $(1,0)$.**

The 7 weights of this representation in the $G_2$ weight lattice are the zero weight (with multiplicity 1) and the 6 short roots of $G_2$ (each with multiplicity 1). Under restriction to $SU(3)$:
- The zero weight becomes the zero weight of $SU(3)$: this is the singlet $\mathbf{1}$, corresponding to the fixed direction $e_7$.
- The 6 short roots project onto the 6 weights of $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$: three weights $(1,0)$, $(-1,1)$, $(0,-1)$ form the $\mathbf{3}$, and their negatives form $\overline{\mathbf{3}}$.

Dimension check: $1 + 3 + 3 = 7$. $\checkmark$

**The adjoint representation $\mathbf{14}$, with highest weight $(0,1)$.**

This was established in Theorem 24.9 by root decomposition. The 14 weights consist of the 12 roots of $G_2$ plus 2 zero weights (the Cartan subalgebra). Under $SU(3)$:
- The 6 long roots of $G_2$ and the 2 zero weights form the adjoint $\mathbf{8}$ of $SU(3)$ (which has weights: 6 roots of $A_2$ plus 2 zero weights).
- The 6 short roots form $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ (as in the fundamental).

Dimension check: $8 + 3 + 3 = 14$. $\checkmark$

**The representation $\mathbf{27}$, with highest weight $(2,0)$.**

We derive the branching by computing the symmetric square of the fundamental representation.

**Lemma.** As $G_2$-representations, $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7}) = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{27}$.

*Proof of Lemma.* The symmetric square has dimension $\binom{8}{2} = 28$. The $G_2$-invariant symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbf{7}$ (the metric $\delta_{ij}$ on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \oplus \mathbb{R}$) provides a copy of $\mathbf{1} \subset \text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7})$. The complement is an irreducible 27-dimensional representation (irreducibility follows from the fact that $G_2$ has no irreducible representations of dimension between 7 and 14 other than the trivial representation, so the complement cannot split further; alternatively, this is verified by the Weyl dimension formula for $(2,0)$, see Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*, Springer GTM 9, 1972, Exercise 24.9). $\square_{\text{Lemma}}$

Now compute $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7})$ under $SU(3)$ using the known branching $\mathbf{7} = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$. For a direct sum $V = A \oplus B \oplus C$:
$$\text{Sym}^2(V) = \text{Sym}^2(A) \oplus (A \otimes B) \oplus (A \otimes C) \oplus \text{Sym}^2(B) \oplus (B \otimes C) \oplus \text{Sym}^2(C)$$

Evaluating each term with $A = \mathbf{1}$, $B = \mathbf{3}$, $C = \overline{\mathbf{3}}$:

| Term | $SU(3)$ decomposition | Dimension |
|------|-----------------------|-----------|
| $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{1})$ | $\mathbf{1}$ | 1 |
| $\mathbf{1} \otimes \mathbf{3}$ | $\mathbf{3}$ | 3 |
| $\mathbf{1} \otimes \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ | $\overline{\mathbf{3}}$ | 3 |
| $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{3})$ | $\mathbf{6}$ | 6 |
| $\mathbf{3} \otimes \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ | $\mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{8}$ | 9 |
| $\text{Sym}^2(\overline{\mathbf{3}})$ | $\overline{\mathbf{6}}$ | 6 |

Justification of the individual decompositions:
- $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{3}) = \mathbf{6}$: the symmetric rank-2 tensor of $SU(3)$ has Dynkin label $(2,0)$, dimension 6.
- $\mathbf{3} \otimes \overline{\mathbf{3}} = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{8}$: the tensor product of fundamental and antifundamental decomposes into trace (the $SU(3)$-invariant $\delta^i_j$, giving $\mathbf{1}$) and traceless part (the adjoint $\mathbf{8}$).
- $\text{Sym}^2(\overline{\mathbf{3}}) = \overline{\mathbf{6}}$: the conjugate of $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{3})$.

Total: $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7}) = 2 \cdot \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{6} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{6}} \oplus \mathbf{8}$.

Dimension check: $2 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 28 = \dim(\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7}))$. $\checkmark$

Since $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7}) = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{27}$ as $G_2$-representations, removing one copy of $\mathbf{1}$ (the $G_2$-invariant metric) gives:

$$\mathbf{27} \to \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{6} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{6}} \oplus \mathbf{8}$$

Dimension check: $1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 27$. $\checkmark$

The $\mathbf{1}$ remaining inside $\mathbf{27}$ is not the same as the removed invariant metric. Under $SU(3)$, the invariant metric $\delta_{ij}$ on $\mathbb{R}^7$ decomposes as the sum of $e_7 \otimes e_7$ (the metric on the $\mathbf{1}$ component) and the Hermitian metric $\delta^i_j$ on $\mathbb{C}^3$ (the $\mathbf{1}$ inside $\mathbf{3} \otimes \overline{\mathbf{3}}$). The particular linear combination that is $G_2$-invariant and is removed is the total metric $\delta_{ij} = (e_7 \otimes e_7) + (\text{Hermitian metric on } V_6)$. This removes one degree of freedom from the two singlets, leaving one independent singlet in the $\mathbf{27}$.

This branching is confirmed by McKay, W.G. and Patera, J., *Tables of Dimensions, Indices, and Branching Rules for Representations of Simple Lie Algebras*, Marcel Dekker, 1981, Table for $G_2 \supset A_2$.

**The representations $\mathbf{64}$ and $\mathbf{77}$: Construction and cited branching.**

For the higher representations, we describe their construction and cite the branching rules from published tables, as the full weight-space decomposition requires extensive combinatorial bookkeeping.

**The $\mathbf{64}$** has Dynkin label $(1,1)$ and can be characterized as follows. The tensor product $\mathbf{7} \otimes \mathbf{14}$ decomposes as:
$$\mathbf{7} \otimes \mathbf{14} = \mathbf{7} \oplus \mathbf{27} \oplus \mathbf{64}$$

Dimension check: $7 \times 14 = 98 = 7 + 27 + 64$. $\checkmark$ (The $\mathbf{7}$ appears because the cross product provides a $G_2$-equivariant map $\mathbf{7} \otimes \mathbf{14} \to \mathbf{7}$, and the $\mathbf{27}$ appears via the symmetric product structure.)

**The $\mathbf{77}$** has Dynkin label $(3,0)$ and is the symmetric traceless cube of the fundamental:
$$\text{Sym}^3(\mathbf{7}) = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{7} \oplus \mathbf{27} \oplus \mathbf{77}$$

Dimension check: $\binom{9}{3} = 84 = 1 + 7 + 27 + ... $. Actually, $\text{Sym}^3(\mathbf{7})$ has dimension $\binom{7+2}{3} = 84$. The decomposition must account for traces: contracting two indices of a symmetric rank-3 tensor with the invariant metric $\delta_{ij}$ gives a vector, providing a copy of $\mathbf{7}$. The fully traceless part is the $\mathbf{77}$. We have $84 = 77 + 7$, confirming $\text{Sym}^3_0(\mathbf{7}) = \mathbf{77}$.

The $SU(3)$ branching rules for $\mathbf{64}$ and $\mathbf{77}$ under $G_2 \supset A_2$ are tabulated in:

- McKay, W.G. and Patera, J., *Tables of Dimensions, Indices, and Branching Rules for Representations of Simple Lie Algebras*, Marcel Dekker, 1981, Chapter on $G_2$.
- Yamatsu, N., "Finite-Dimensional Lie Algebras and Their Representations for Unified Model Building," arXiv:1511.08771 (2015), Appendix D, Table D.70.

The $SU(3)$ branching of these representations can in principle be computed from the known branchings of $\mathbf{7}$ and $\mathbf{14}$ via the tensor product method used above for $\mathbf{27}$, but the bookkeeping involves decomposing tensor products of $SU(3)$ representations up to dimension 27 and tracking multiplicities carefully. We defer the explicit computation to computational verification (see Appendix C).

**Status of higher branching rules:** The branchings of $\mathbf{7}$, $\mathbf{14}$, and $\mathbf{27}$ are derived from first principles in this chapter. The branchings of $\mathbf{64}$ and $\mathbf{77}$ are cited from the literature and should be verified computationally. $\square$

### 24.8.1 Branching Under the Full Chain

**Corollary 24.11.** Under $G_2 \supset SU(3) \supset SU(2) \times U(1)$, the fundamental $\mathbf{7}$ decomposes as:

$$\mathbf{7} \xrightarrow{SU(3)} \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \xrightarrow{SU(2) \times U(1)} \mathbf{1}_0 \oplus (\mathbf{2}_{1/2} \oplus \mathbf{1}_{-1}) \oplus (\mathbf{2}_{-1/2} \oplus \mathbf{1}_1)$$

where subscripts denote $U(1)$ charges.

This decomposition shows that the 7 imaginary octonion directions encode:
- 1 singlet (the reference direction $e_7$)
- 2 doublets (with $U(1)$ charges $\pm 1/2$) corresponding to the weak doublets
- 2 singlets (with $U(1)$ charges $\pm 1$) corresponding to charged singlets

## 24.9 New Gauge Structure Beyond the Standard Model

**Theorem 24.12.** The 6 generators of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ outside $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ (i.e., in $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$) define gauge interactions with the following properties:

**(a)** They transform as color triplets under $SU(3)$.

**(b)** They mediate transitions between the $\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbf{3}$ sectors of the fundamental representation: a particle in the singlet state (colorless) can absorb a $\mathbf{3}$-boson and become colored.

**(c)** These interactions are invisible in 3D projections: under the quaternionic projection $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$, the $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ generators project to zero.

*Proof.*

**(a):** The $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ transforms in the fundamental and antifundamental representations of $SU(3)$ by definition of the branching rule.

**(b):** The generators $X_k = D_{e_7, e_k}$ for $k = 1, \ldots, 6$ satisfy:
$$X_k(e_7) = D_{e_7, e_k}(e_7) = \frac{1}{3}([e_7, [e_k, e_7]] - [e_k, [e_7, e_7]])$$

Since $[e_7, e_7] = 0$ and $[e_k, e_7] = 2e_k e_7$ (for imaginary octonions with $e_k \perp e_7$), we get:
$$X_k(e_7) = \frac{1}{3}[e_7, 2e_k e_7] = \frac{2}{3}(e_7(e_k e_7) - (e_k e_7)e_7)$$

Using the Moufang identity and $|e_7|^2 = 1$:
$$e_7(e_k e_7) = (e_7 e_k)e_7 - [e_7, e_k, e_7]$$

The associator $[e_7, e_k, e_7] = 0$ by the flexible identity (any alternative algebra satisfies $[a, b, a] = 0$). Therefore:
$$e_7(e_k e_7) = (e_7 e_k)e_7 = -(e_k e_7)e_7 = -e_k(e_7 e_7) = -e_k(-1) = e_k$$

(using alternativity: $(e_k e_7)e_7 = e_k(e_7 e_7) = -e_k$). So:
$$X_k(e_7) = \frac{2}{3}(e_k - (-e_k)) = \frac{4}{3}e_k$$

(Up to normalization convention.) This confirms that $X_k$ maps $e_7$ (the singlet) to $e_k$ (in the triplet).

**(c):** Under the quaternionic projection $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$ with $\mathbb{H} = \text{span}\{1, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$, the derivation $X_k = D_{e_7, e_k}$ involves $e_7$ which lies outside $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ (since $e_7 \in \{e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\}$). When we restrict to the $\mathbb{H}$-subalgebra:
- The generator $X_k$ acts on elements of $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ by moving them toward $e_7$, which is projected to zero.
- More precisely, $\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(X_k(v)) = 0$ for $v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ because $X_k(v) \in \text{span}\{e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\} = \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})^{\perp}$.

Therefore these generators are invisible in the 3D projection. $\square$

## 24.10 The Standard Model Gauge Bosons in Octonionic Language

| Standard Model | $\mathfrak{g}_2$ generator | Octonionic derivation | Action on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 8 gluons ($g_1, \ldots, g_8$) | $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_8 \in \mathfrak{su}(3)$ | $D_{e_i, e_j}$ with $i,j \in \{1,\ldots,6\}$ | Rotations within $V_6 = e_7^{\perp}$ |

| $B$ (hypercharge) | $U(1)$ generator | $D_{e_1, e_4} - D_{e_2, e_5}$ | Phase rotation in $(e_1, e_2)$-plane |
| 6 new bosons | $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ | $D_{e_7, e_k}$ for $k = 1, \ldots, 6$ | Rotation between $e_7$ and $V_6$ |

## 24.11 What the New Gauge Structure Predicts

**Proposition 24.13.** The 6 extra gauge bosons in $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ have the following properties:

1. **Mass scale.** If $G_2$ is spontaneously broken to $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ by a Higgs-like mechanism, the 6 extra bosons acquire mass proportional to the $G_2$ breaking scale. If this scale is at the Planck energy, they are unobservable at current energies.

2. **Color-singlet transitions.** They mediate transitions between "colored" and "colorless" states — potentially relevant for baryon number violation and proton decay.

3. **Non-associative interactions.** The coupling of these bosons involves the octonionic associator: the interaction vertex for three such bosons is proportional to $[X_i, X_j, X_k]$, which is generically nonzero. This is a new type of gauge interaction with no associative counterpart.

4. **$G_2$ confinement.** Just as $SU(3)$ color confinement prevents observation of free quarks, if the full $G_2$ gauge theory confines, then the extra bosons would only appear in $G_2$-singlet bound states.

---

## 24.12 Worked Example: The Embedding for $e_7$-Stabilizer

**Example 24.14.** We carry out the full embedding explicitly for the choice $u = e_7$.

**Step 1:** $G_2$ acts on $S^6 \subset \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$. The stabilizer of $e_7$ is $SU(3)$.

**Step 2:** The complex structure on $V_6 = \{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\}$ is:
$$J = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

(acting on the ordered basis $(e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6)$, with $J(e_k) = e_7 e_k$.)

**Step 3:** The complex coordinates are $z_j = e_j + iJ(e_j) = e_j + ie_{j+3}$ for $j = 1, 2, 3$.

**Step 4:** An $SU(3)$ element $A \in SU(3)$ acts as:
$$(z_1, z_2, z_3) \mapsto A(z_1, z_2, z_3)^T$$
which in real coordinates on $V_6$ is a $6 \times 6$ real matrix commuting with $J$.

**Step 5:** Restricting to $SU(2) \subset SU(3)$ stabilizing $z_3$:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} B & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad B \in SU(2)$$

**Step 6:** The $U(1)$ is the diagonal:
$$B = \begin{pmatrix} e^{i\theta} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{-i\theta} \end{pmatrix}$$

which acts as rotation by $\theta$ in the $(e_1, e_4)$-plane and by $-\theta$ in the $(e_2, e_5)$-plane.

## 24.13 Three Generations: The Octonionic Generation Problem

The Standard Model contains exactly three generations of fermions: $(e, \nu_e, u, d)$, $(\mu, \nu_\mu, c, s)$, $(\tau, \nu_\tau, t, b)$. No principle in the Standard Model itself explains this number. The octonionic framework, with its rich algebraic structure, offers several suggestive — but not yet rigorous — approaches to deriving the number 3. This section states clearly what is established, what is suggestive, and what remains open.

### 24.13.1 What Is Proven

The following results from this chapter are rigorous:

1. **$SU(3) \subset G_2 = \text{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$** (Theorem 24.3). The color group arises as the stabilizer of a unit imaginary octonion.

2. **The branching rule $\mathbf{7} \to \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{1}$** (Theorem 24.10). The fundamental representation of $G_2$ decomposes into a color triplet, an antitriplet, and a singlet under $SU(3)$.

3. **The full subgroup chain $U(1) \subset SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$** (Theorem 24.8). The Standard Model gauge group (modulo discrete quotient) embeds in $G_2$.

These results show that the octonions naturally accommodate *one generation* of color structure. But they do not, by themselves, produce three generations.

### 24.13.2 Three Quaternionic Subalgebras

The octonions contain exactly 7 quaternionic subalgebras $\mathbb{H}_i$, one for each line of the Fano plane (Proposition 23.1). Each subalgebra is spanned by $\{1, e_a, e_b, e_c\}$ where $(a,b,c)$ is a Fano triple.

**Key structural fact.** Among these 7 quaternionic subalgebras, one can find sets of three that are *maximally independent* in the following sense:

**Definition 24.15.** Three quaternionic subalgebras $\mathbb{H}_1, \mathbb{H}_2, \mathbb{H}_3 \subset \mathbb{O}$ are *independent* if they pairwise share only the real line:
$$\text{Im}(\mathbb{H}_i) \cap \text{Im}(\mathbb{H}_j) = \{0\} \quad \text{for } i \neq j$$

**Proposition 24.16.** The Fano plane admits sets of three pairwise disjoint lines. Concretely, consider the Fano lines:
$$L_1 = (1, 2, 3), \quad L_2 = (4, 5, 1)^*, \quad L_3 = (2, 4, 6)$$

(where $^*$ indicates that the particular triple depends on the multiplication table convention). The three quaternionic subalgebras corresponding to three pairwise disjoint Fano lines have $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H}_i) \cap \text{Im}(\mathbb{H}_j) = \{0\}$ for $i \neq j$, and together their imaginary parts span 6 of the 7 imaginary directions. The remaining imaginary direction is the one that appears on none of the three lines.

*Proof.* A set of three pairwise disjoint lines in the Fano plane covers $3 \times 3 = 9$ point-incidences, but the Fano plane has only 7 points, so two lines cannot be disjoint sets of three points from seven unless they share no points and the third shares none with either. In fact, the Fano plane has exactly 7 lines, and one can verify combinatorially that it admits exactly 7 sets of three pairwise disjoint points spanning three lines — but one CANNOT find three pairwise disjoint Fano lines, since any two lines in the Fano plane either share a point or the complement of their union is a single point (which lies on the remaining lines).

**Correction and refinement.** The Fano plane is a $(7_3)$-configuration: 7 points, 7 lines, 3 points per line, 3 lines through each point. A simple counting argument shows that any two distinct lines share exactly 0 or 1 points. In fact, any two lines share exactly 1 point (this is a projective plane of order 2). Therefore, one *cannot* find three pairwise disjoint Fano lines.

However, one can find three lines whose pairwise intersections are all *distinct*. For example:
$$L_1 = (1, 2, 3), \quad L_2 = (1, 4, 5), \quad L_3 = (2, 4, 6)$$

These share: $L_1 \cap L_2 = \{1\}$, $L_1 \cap L_3 = \{2\}$, $L_2 \cap L_3 = \{4\}$. The union covers 6 distinct imaginary directions $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, leaving $e_7$ uncovered. The three quaternionic subalgebras corresponding to these lines share imaginary directions pairwise (each pair shares exactly one imaginary unit), but no imaginary direction lies in all three. This is the *maximal independence* achievable in the Fano geometry. $\square$

**Suggestive observation.** The existence of exactly three maximally independent quaternionic subalgebras (covering 6 of 7 imaginary directions, with one "spectator" direction) is numerically resonant with three generations. Each subalgebra provides an $SU(2) \subset \mathbb{H}_i^{\times}$ symmetry; each could in principle govern one generation of fermions. The uncovered direction ($e_7$ in the example above) plays the role of the stabilized direction defining $SU(3) \subset G_2$.

**Status: SUGGESTIVE.** There is no rigorous derivation showing that these three subalgebras produce three independent copies of fermion representations. The numerology is striking but not a proof.

### 24.13.3 Triality and Complex Structures

A second potential source of the number 3 comes from triality, the outer automorphism of $\text{Spin}(8)$.

**Background.** The Dynkin diagram $D_4$ (for $\mathfrak{so}(8)$) has a unique $S_3$ (order-6) symmetry permuting its three legs. This induces an outer automorphism group $\text{Out}(\text{Spin}(8)) \cong S_3$, known as *triality*. The three 8-dimensional representations of $\text{Spin}(8)$ — the vector representation $\mathbf{8}_v$ and the two half-spinor representations $\mathbf{8}_s$ and $\mathbf{8}_c$ — are permuted by triality.

**Connection to octonions.** The octonions are intimately related to triality through the identity:
$$a(bc) = \tilde{a} \cdot_s \tilde{b} \cdot_c \tilde{c}$$

where the three factors live in the three distinct 8-dimensional representations of $\text{Spin}(8)$. More precisely, the trilinear form $t(a, b, c) = \langle a, bc \rangle$ on $\mathbb{O} \times \mathbb{O} \times \mathbb{O}$ is invariant under simultaneous triality rotations acting on the three copies of $\mathbb{O}$.

**The generation proposal (Boyle, 2020; see also Furey, 2018).** The idea is that the three representations $\mathbf{8}_v$, $\mathbf{8}_s$, $\mathbf{8}_c$, related by triality, could correspond to three generations of fermions. Under the subgroup $G_2 \subset \text{Spin}(7) \subset \text{Spin}(8)$, all three 8-dimensional representations restrict to $\mathbf{7} \oplus \mathbf{1}$. Each then decomposes under $SU(3) \subset G_2$ as $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{1}$. This gives three copies of the color decomposition.

**Status: SUGGESTIVE but with serious caveats.**

1. Triality permutes the three representations — so they are *isomorphic* as $G_2$-representations. This is consistent with the fact that the three generations of fermions have identical gauge quantum numbers. But it does not explain why the three generations have *different masses*.

2. Mass splittings would require triality to be *broken*, and the breaking pattern would need to reproduce the Yukawa hierarchy. No mechanism for this has been rigorously derived from the octonionic structure alone.

3. The relationship between the $\text{Spin}(8)$ triality and the $G_2 = \text{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$ symmetry of this chapter needs careful analysis: $G_2$ is the *fixed-point subgroup* of triality within $\text{Spin}(8)$, so triality is in some sense "orthogonal" to the $G_2$ structure we have been using.

### 24.13.4 The Dixon--Furey Program

A third approach uses the full algebra of division algebras.

**Dixon (1994)** proposed that the algebra $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R} \otimes \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H} \otimes \mathbb{O}$ (the "Dixon algebra") encodes the full Standard Model. The tensor product has dimension $1 \times 2 \times 4 \times 8 = 64 = 2^6$, which equals the dimension of a Weyl spinor of $\text{Spin}(12, 1)$ or equivalently the complex Clifford algebra $\text{Cl}(6, \mathbb{C})$.

**Furey (2016, 2018)** showed that the Clifford algebra $\text{Cl}(6) \cong \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H} \otimes \mathbb{O}$ (the complexified "quaternionic-octonionic" algebra) contains exactly one generation of Standard Model fermions with the correct quantum numbers under $SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{em}$. The 64 real degrees of freedom decompose into:
- Left-handed quarks (3 colors $\times$ 2 flavors = 6)
- Left-handed leptons (2)
- Their antiparticles (8 more)
- Right-handed counterparts (16 more)
- Matching the 32 complex (= 64 real) degrees of freedom of one generation.

**The generation problem in this program.** To obtain three generations, one needs to extend the algebra. Proposed extensions include:

- **$\text{Cl}(6) \otimes \text{Cl}(6) \otimes \text{Cl}(6)$:** Three copies of the algebra, one per generation. But this is *ad hoc* — it simply postulates three copies rather than deriving them.

- **$\text{Cl}(8) \cong \mathbb{R}(16)$:** Extending from $\text{Cl}(6)$ to $\text{Cl}(8)$ by adding two generators. The 256-dimensional algebra decomposes as $64 \times 4$, but the extra factor of 4 gives 4 generations (too many) unless one is projected out by a mechanism that remains unclear.

- **Left-right action:** Furey (2018) suggested using both left and right actions of the algebra on itself. The left ideal gives one generation; additional generations might come from right ideals or bi-ideals. This approach is under active development but has not yet produced a complete three-generation model.

**Status: PROMISING but INCOMPLETE.** The Furey program succeeds in deriving one generation from a single copy of $\mathbb{O}$. Extending to three generations remains the central open problem of this research program.

### 24.13.5 The Exceptional Jordan Algebra

A fourth approach uses the exceptional Jordan algebra $J_3(\mathbb{O})$, the algebra of $3 \times 3$ Hermitian matrices over $\mathbb{O}$:

$$J_3(\mathbb{O}) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} \alpha & a & \bar{b} \\ \bar{a} & \beta & c \\ b & \bar{c} & \gamma \end{pmatrix} : \alpha, \beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}, \; a, b, c \in \mathbb{O} \right\}$$

This algebra has dimension $3 + 3 \times 8 = 27$ and its automorphism group is the exceptional Lie group $F_4$, with $\dim F_4 = 52$.

**The observation.** The *three* off-diagonal octonionic entries $a, b, c \in \mathbb{O}$ provide a natural triplication of the octonionic structure. Each entry $a$, $b$, $c$ lives in a copy of $\mathbb{O}$, and the three copies are interchanged by the $S_3$ permutation symmetry of the $3 \times 3$ matrix indices. Under the subgroup $G_2 \subset F_4$ (acting on each octonionic entry), the 27-dimensional representation decomposes as:
$$\mathbf{27} \to 3 \times \mathbf{7} + 3 \times \mathbf{1} + \mathbf{3}$$

This gives three copies of the 7-dimensional representation — and by the branching rule of Theorem 24.10, three copies of $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{1}$ under $SU(3) \subset G_2$.

**Boyle (2020)** explored this direction, connecting the 27-dimensional representation to the particle content of one generation (plus scalar degrees of freedom) and using the $3 \times 3$ matrix structure to generate three generations. The approach interfaces naturally with string/M-theory compactifications on $G_2$-holonomy manifolds.

**Status: SUGGESTIVE.** The $3 \times 3$ matrix structure is imposed by the definition of $J_3(\mathbb{O})$ — the number 3 is an *input* to this construction, not a *derived* consequence of the octonionic algebra. One could equally well consider $J_2(\mathbb{O})$ (which gives 2 copies) or $J_4(\mathbb{O})$ (which is not a Jordan algebra, because the Jordan identity fails for $4 \times 4$ octonionic matrices — but this *obstruction* at $n = 4$ could itself be the explanation for why nature stops at 3). This last point is suggestive but has not been made rigorous.

### 24.13.6 Honest Assessment

**What the octonionic structure provides:**
- The number 3 appears in multiple independent ways: three maximally independent quaternionic subalgebras (Section 24.13.2), $\text{Spin}(8)$ triality (Section 24.13.3), three off-diagonal entries in $J_3(\mathbb{O})$ (Section 24.13.5), and the maximal matrix size for exceptional Jordan algebras.
- Each mechanism produces three copies of the same gauge representation, consistent with the experimental fact that the three generations share identical quantum numbers.

**What is NOT yet established:**
- No single mechanism rigorously derives three generations from a *single copy* of $\mathbb{O}$ with no additional input.
- The mass hierarchy between generations ($m_t / m_u \approx 7.5 \times 10^4$) is not explained by any of these approaches. Even if three generations are obtained, the Yukawa couplings remain unexplained.
- The relationship between the various "sources of 3" (quaternionic subalgebras, triality, $J_3(\mathbb{O})$) is not understood. Are they different manifestations of the same underlying mechanism, or genuinely independent?

**Most promising attack strategies:**

1. **Triality breaking.** Study mechanisms by which $\text{Spin}(8)$ triality is spontaneously broken to $G_2$. The breaking pattern $\text{Spin}(8) \to G_2$ leaves the triality as a *residual discrete symmetry* that permutes three equivalent sectors. Investigate whether this discrete $S_3$ can be further broken to generate mass splittings.

2. **$J_3(\mathbb{O})$ obstruction.** Make rigorous the observation that $J_n(\mathbb{O})$ is a Jordan algebra only for $n \leq 3$. If the physical algebra *must* be Jordan (for unitarity or positivity reasons), this would derive the number 3 as a mathematical necessity rather than an empirical input.

3. **Furey extension.** Complete the Furey program by finding the algebraic mechanism within $\text{Cl}(6) \cong \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H} \otimes \mathbb{O}$ (or a minimal extension) that produces exactly three independent left ideals with the correct quantum numbers.

4. **$G_2$-holonomy compactification.** In M-theory, compactification on $G_2$-holonomy manifolds gives $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry in 4D. The number of generations is determined by the topology of the $G_2$-manifold (specifically, the third Betti number $b_3$). Investigate whether natural $G_2$-manifolds constructed from octonionic data have $b_3 = 3$.

## 24.14 Formalization Status

The proofs in this chapter range from fully rigorous to cited-from-literature. A detailed assessment:

1. **$\dim(\mathfrak{g}_2) = 14$, simplicity** (Proposition 24.2): Proved by exhibiting 14 linearly independent derivations via the $D_{a,b}$ construction (Schafer, 1966, Chapter III, Theorem 3.29), with the 7 linear relations from Fano triples reducing $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ candidates to 14. The earlier claim of "7 independent conditions on 21 parameters" has been corrected: the constraint system has 49 equations of rank 35, but the counting is most cleanly seen through the 7 linear dependences among the 21 generating derivations. Simplicity follows from the root system being irreducible of type $G_2$ (Humphreys, 1972, Theorem 14.2).

2. **$SU(3) \subset G_2$** (Theorem 24.3): Fully rigorous. Classical result (Cartan; see also Bryant, 1987; Harvey, 1990) proved here via the stabilizer argument with explicit octonionic computation of the complex structure $J$ on $V_6$ and the holomorphic volume form.

3. **$SU(2) \subset SU(3)$** (Theorem 24.5): Fully rigorous. Standard subgroup theory of $SU(n)$.

4. **$U(1) \subset SU(2)$** (Theorem 24.7): Fully rigorous. The maximal torus.

5. **$G_{\text{SM}}/\mathbb{Z}_6$ embedding** (Theorem 24.8(iv)): The $\mathbb{Z}_6$ quotient structure is explained through the center actions on the $\mathbf{7}$ representation, with references to Baez (2002, Section 4.3) and Tong (2017, Section 2). The key point is that in the $G_2$ embedding the subgroups are nested (not a direct product), so the quotient is automatic.

6. **Branching rules** (Theorem 24.10):
   - $\mathbf{7} \to \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$: Derived from weight decomposition. **Fully rigorous.**
   - $\mathbf{14} \to \mathbf{8} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$: Derived from root decomposition. **Fully rigorous.**
   - $\mathbf{27} \to \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{6} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{6}} \oplus \mathbf{8}$: Derived from $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbf{7})$ decomposition. **Fully rigorous.**
   - $\mathbf{64}$ and $\mathbf{77}$: Cited from McKay-Patera (1981) and Yamatsu (2015). **Cited, not independently derived.** Computational verification is recommended.

7. **New gauge bosons** (Theorem 24.12): The existence of the $\mathbf{3} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{3}}$ in the branching $\mathfrak{g}_2 \to \mathfrak{su}(3)$ is a mathematical fact. The physical interpretation as new gauge bosons is a consequence of promoting $G_2$ to a gauge group; this is standard in GUT (Grand Unified Theory) constructions.
