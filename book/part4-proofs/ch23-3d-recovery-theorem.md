# Chapter 23: The 3D Recovery Theorem

## 23.1 Introduction and Motivation

This is the backward-compatibility guarantee of the entire framework. Every valid result in classical 3D mathematics — vector calculus, Lie theory, gauge theory, PBW bases, the Killing form — must be recoverable as a projection from the 7D octonionic setting. Without this theorem, the octonionic framework would be an extension that potentially contradicts existing mathematics. With it, we establish that the octonionic framework is a *faithful enlargement*: it contains strictly more structure, but when restricted to the appropriate subalgebra, it reproduces exactly the classical theory.

The key mechanism is the *quaternionic projection*: since every quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H} \subset \mathbb{O}$ is associative and 4-dimensional (with 3D imaginary part), projecting onto $\mathbb{H}$ discards the non-associative structure and recovers the classical world.

## 23.2 The Quaternionic Projection

### 23.2.1 Quaternionic Subalgebras of $\mathbb{O}$

**Proposition 23.1.** The octonion algebra $\mathbb{O}$ contains exactly $\frac{7 \cdot 6}{3!} \cdot 3! = 7$ quaternionic subalgebras (up to orientation), each corresponding to an oriented line of the Fano plane.

*Proof.* A quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H} \subset \mathbb{O}$ is spanned by $\{1, e_a, e_b, e_c\}$ where $e_a e_b = e_c$ (a Fano line). The Fano plane has exactly 7 lines. Each line determines a quaternionic subalgebra because:
1. Closure: $e_a e_b = e_c \in \mathbb{H}$, and all other products are determined by anticommutativity ($e_b e_a = -e_c$) and $e_i^2 = -1$.
2. Associativity: For any $x, y, z \in \{e_a, e_b, e_c\}$, $(xy)z = x(yz)$. This is verified directly: any two of $\{e_a, e_b, e_c\}$ generate an associative subalgebra by Artin's theorem, and since $e_c = e_a e_b$, all three elements lie in the subalgebra generated by $e_a$ and $e_b$. $\square$

**Definition 23.2** (Quaternionic projection). Fix a quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H} = \text{span}_{\mathbb{R}}\{1, e_a, e_b, e_c\} \subset \mathbb{O}$. The *quaternionic projection* is the $\mathbb{R}$-linear map:
$$\pi_{\mathbb{H}}: \mathbb{O} \to \mathbb{H}$$
defined by orthogonal projection with respect to the standard inner product on $\mathbb{O}$:
$$\pi_{\mathbb{H}}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{7} \alpha_i e_i\right) = \alpha_0 \cdot 1 + \alpha_a e_a + \alpha_b e_b + \alpha_c e_c$$

where $e_0 = 1$.

**Lemma 23.3.** The quaternionic projection satisfies:
1. $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$ is $\mathbb{R}$-linear and surjective.
2. $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}|_{\mathbb{H}} = \text{id}_{\mathbb{H}}$ (it is a retraction).
3. $\ker(\pi_{\mathbb{H}}) = \mathbb{H}^{\perp} \cong \mathbb{R}^4$.
4. $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$ is NOT an algebra homomorphism: $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}(xy) \neq \pi_{\mathbb{H}}(x)\pi_{\mathbb{H}}(y)$ in general.

*Proof.* Parts (1)-(3) are immediate from the definition of orthogonal projection. For (4), take $x = e_d, y = e_f$ where $e_d, e_f \notin \mathbb{H}$ but $e_d e_f \in \mathbb{H}$. Then $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}(x) = 0 = \pi_{\mathbb{H}}(y)$ but $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}(xy) \neq 0$. $\square$

**Remark.** The failure of $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$ to be an algebra homomorphism is fundamental. The projection is a *linear* projection, not an algebraic one. When we say "classical results are recovered by projection," we mean that certain *structures* (cross products, Lie groups, bases, bilinear forms) project correctly — not that every individual multiplication is preserved.

### 23.2.2 The Imaginary Projection

**Definition 23.4.** The *imaginary quaternionic projection* is:
$$\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}: \text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \to \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$$
the restriction of $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$ to the imaginary parts. This maps $\mathbb{R}^7 \to \mathbb{R}^3$.

---

## 23.3 Part (a): Recovery of the 3D Cross Product

**Theorem 23.5.** Let $\mathbb{H} = \text{span}\{1, e_1, e_2, e_3\} \subset \mathbb{O}$ (the quaternionic subalgebra corresponding to the Fano line $e_1 e_2 = e_3$). For any $u, v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H}) \subset \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$:

$$\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_7 v) = u \times_3 v$$

where $\times_7$ is the 7D octonionic cross product and $\times_3$ is the standard 3D cross product.

*Proof.* Let $u = u_1 e_1 + u_2 e_2 + u_3 e_3$ and $v = v_1 e_1 + v_2 e_2 + v_3 e_3$, where $u, v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$.

**Step 1: Compute $u \times_7 v$.** The 7D cross product is defined by:
$$u \times_7 v = \text{Im}(uv) = \frac{uv - vu}{2}$$

Since $u, v \in \mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{H}$ is associative, the product $uv$ is computed using quaternion multiplication:
$$uv = -(u \cdot v) + u \times_3 v$$
where $u \cdot v = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + u_3 v_3$ (dot product) and $u \times_3 v$ is the standard cross product (the imaginary part of the quaternion product).

Similarly, $vu = -(u \cdot v) - u \times_3 v$.

Therefore:
$$u \times_7 v = \text{Im}(uv) = \text{Im}(-(u \cdot v) + u \times_3 v) = u \times_3 v$$

Here $u \cdot v$ is real and contributes nothing to the imaginary part, while $u \times_3 v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ is already purely imaginary.

**Step 2: Apply the projection.** Since $u \times_3 v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$, we have:
$$\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_7 v) = \pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_3 v) = u \times_3 v$$

This completes the proof. $\square$

**Corollary 23.6.** The 7D cross product restricted to any 3D quaternionic imaginary subspace IS the 3D cross product — no information is lost, no distortion occurs.

**Corollary 23.7.** For vectors $u \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ and $w \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ with $w \notin \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$:
$$\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_7 w) = u \times_3 \pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(w)$$

*Proof.* Write $w = w_{\parallel} + w_{\perp}$ where $w_{\parallel} \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ and $w_{\perp} \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})^{\perp}$. By bilinearity:
$$u \times_7 w = u \times_7 w_{\parallel} + u \times_7 w_{\perp}$$

For the first term, $u \times_7 w_{\parallel} = u \times_3 w_{\parallel}$ by Theorem 23.5.

For the second term, we must show $\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_7 w_{\perp}) = 0$. This follows from:
$$u \times_7 w_{\perp} = \text{Im}(u \cdot w_{\perp})$$

Writing $u = u_1 e_1 + u_2 e_2 + u_3 e_3$ and $w_{\perp} = w_4 e_4 + w_5 e_5 + w_6 e_6 + w_7 e_7$, the product $u \cdot w_{\perp}$ involves terms $e_i e_j$ where $e_i \in \{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ and $e_j \in \{e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\}$. By the Fano plane multiplication rules, each such product $e_i e_j$ yields $\pm e_k$ where $e_k \in \{e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\}$ (products of elements from different quaternionic triples yield elements outside the original triple). Therefore $u \times_7 w_{\perp} \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})^{\perp}$, and:
$$\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_7 w_{\perp}) = 0$$

Combining: $\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_7 w) = u \times_3 w_{\parallel} = u \times_3 \pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(w)$. $\square$

---

## 23.4 Part (b): Recovery of $SO(3)$ from $G_2$

**Theorem 23.8.** The quaternionic projection induces a group-theoretic reduction:
$$G_2 \supset SU(3) \supset SU(2) \cong S^3$$
and the action of $SU(2)$ on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H}) \cong \mathbb{R}^3$ yields $SO(3) \cong SU(2)/\{\pm 1\}$.

*Proof.* We establish the chain of subgroups step by step.

**Step 1: $SU(3) \subset G_2$.** Fix a unit imaginary octonion, say $e_7 \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$. The stabilizer of $e_7$ under the $G_2$ action on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \mathbb{R}^7$ is:
$$\text{Stab}_{G_2}(e_7) = \{g \in G_2 : g(e_7) = e_7\}$$

**Claim:** $\text{Stab}_{G_2}(e_7) \cong SU(3)$.

*Proof of claim.* The element $e_7$ determines a splitting $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) = \mathbb{R} e_7 \oplus V_6$ where $V_6 = e_7^{\perp} \cap \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ is the 6-dimensional orthogonal complement. The space $V_6$ carries a natural complex structure $J$ defined by:
$$J(v) = e_7 \times_7 v \quad \text{for } v \in V_6$$

We verify that $J^2 = -\text{id}$: for $v \in V_6$,
$$J^2(v) = e_7 \times_7 (e_7 \times_7 v)$$

Using the Moufang identity and the fact that $e_7^2 = -1$:
$$e_7 \times_7 (e_7 \times_7 v) = e_7(e_7 v) - e_7 \cdot (e_7 \cdot v) \cdot 1$$

More precisely, using the identity for pure imaginary octonions $a \times (a \times b) = a(ab) + |a|^2 b$ applied to unit $a = e_7$:
$$e_7 \times_7 (e_7 \times_7 v) = -v + (e_7 \cdot v)e_7 = -v$$

(the last equality uses $v \perp e_7$, so $e_7 \cdot v = 0$). Thus $J^2 = -\text{id}$, confirming that $V_6 \cong \mathbb{C}^3$.

Any $g \in \text{Stab}_{G_2}(e_7)$ preserves $V_6$ (since it fixes $e_7$), preserves the metric (since $G_2 \subset SO(7)$), and commutes with $J$ (since $J$ is defined using only $e_7$ and the cross product, both preserved by $g$). Therefore $g|_{V_6}$ is a unitary transformation of $(\mathbb{C}^3, J)$.

The dimension count confirms: $\dim G_2 = 14$, $\dim S^6 = 6$ (the orbit of $e_7$ under $G_2$ is $S^6$ since $G_2$ acts transitively on unit imaginary octonions), so $\dim \text{Stab}_{G_2}(e_7) = 14 - 6 = 8 = \dim SU(3)$.

The group $\text{Stab}_{G_2}(e_7)$ is connected (since $G_2$ is connected and $S^6$ is simply connected, the long exact sequence of the fibration gives $\pi_0(\text{Stab}) = 0$), compact, 8-dimensional, and acts faithfully on $\mathbb{C}^3$ preserving the Hermitian structure. The only such group is $SU(3)$. $\square_{\text{claim}}$

**Step 2: $SU(2) \subset SU(3)$.** Fix a second unit imaginary octonion $e_3 \in V_6$ (with $e_3 \perp e_7$). The stabilizer of $e_3$ within $SU(3)$ is:
$$\text{Stab}_{SU(3)}(e_3) = \{g \in SU(3) : g(e_3) = e_3\}$$

The element $e_3$ determines a splitting $V_6 = \mathbb{C} e_3 \oplus V_4$ where $V_4 \cong \mathbb{C}^2$. An element of $SU(3)$ stabilizing $e_3$ must act on $V_4$ as an element of $SU(2)$. Dimension count: $\dim SU(3) = 8$, the orbit of $e_3$ under $SU(3)$ acting on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^3$ is $S^5$ ($\dim = 5$), so $\dim \text{Stab} = 8 - 5 = 3 = \dim SU(2)$.

**Step 3: $SU(2) \to SO(3)$.** The quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H} = \text{span}\{1, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ is invariant under the $SU(2)$ factor. The $SU(2)$ action on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H}) \cong \mathbb{R}^3$ by conjugation:
$$g \cdot v = gvg^{-1} \quad \text{for } g \in SU(2) \cong S^3 \subset \mathbb{H}, \, v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$$
yields a surjective homomorphism $SU(2) \to SO(3)$ with kernel $\{\pm 1\}$. This is the classical double cover.

**Step 4: Commutativity with projection.** The projection $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$ intertwines the $G_2$ action and the $SO(3)$ action: for $g \in SU(2) \subset G_2$ and $v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$:
$$\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(g \cdot v) = g \cdot \pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(v)$$

where the left $g$ acts via $G_2$ on $\mathbb{R}^7$ and the right $g$ acts via $SO(3)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$. This holds because $g \in SU(2) \subset \mathbb{H}$ preserves $\mathbb{H}$ and its orthogonal complement. $\square$

## 23.5 Part (c): Recovery of Classical PBW Bases

**Theorem 23.9.** Let $S$ be a Sabinin algebra over $\mathbb{O}$ and $\mathbb{H} \subset \mathbb{O}$ a quaternionic subalgebra. Define $S_{\mathbb{H}} = \pi_{\mathbb{H}}(S)$, viewed as a Lie algebra over $\mathbb{H}$ (with the Sabinin bracket reducing to the Lie bracket). Then the quaternionic projection of the COPBW basis for $U_{\mathbb{O}}(S)$ yields the classical PBW basis for $U(S_{\mathbb{H}})$:

$$\pi_{\mathbb{H}}(\mathcal{B}_{\text{COPBW}}) = \mathcal{B}_{\text{PBW}}$$

*Proof.* The proof proceeds in three steps.

**Step 1: Projection of the algebra structure.** The restriction of the $\mathbb{O}$-module structure of $S$ to $\mathbb{H}$-scalars yields an $\mathbb{H}$-module $S_{\mathbb{H}}$. Since $\mathbb{H}$ is associative, the scalar compatibility relation (R4) becomes trivial:
$$(\lambda \mu) \cdot x = \lambda \cdot (\mu \cdot x) \quad \text{for all } \lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{H}, \, x \in S_{\mathbb{H}}$$

The higher Sabinin operations $\Phi_{m,n}$ vanish on $S_{\mathbb{H}}$ because they are determined by octonionic associators, which vanish when restricted to $\mathbb{H}$. Therefore $S_{\mathbb{H}}$ is a Lie algebra (Sabinin algebra with vanishing higher operations).

**Step 2: Projection of tree monomials.** A canonical tree monomial $T_\sigma(x_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_n})$ in the COPBW basis involves:
- Leaf labels $x_{i_j} \in S$, which project to $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}(x_{i_j}) \in S_{\mathbb{H}}$.
- A tree shape $\sigma \in \mathcal{T}_n / \sim_{\text{alt}}$.

When all scalars are in $\mathbb{H}$ and all elements are in $S_{\mathbb{H}}$, associativity holds (by Artin's theorem — any two elements of $\mathbb{H}$ generate an associative subalgebra, and since $\mathbb{H}$ itself is associative, all elements do). Therefore all tree shapes become equivalent:
$$T_\sigma(x_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_n}) = T_{\sigma'}(x_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_n}) \quad \text{for all } \sigma, \sigma' \in \mathcal{T}_n$$

when evaluated in $S_{\mathbb{H}}$. The canonical tree monomial reduces to the unique (parenthesization-independent) ordered monomial $x_{i_1} \cdots x_{i_n}$.

**Step 3: Projection of the basis.** The COPBW basis elements project as:
$$\pi_{\mathbb{H}}(T_\sigma(x_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_n})) = \pi_{\mathbb{H}}(x_{i_1}) \cdots \pi_{\mathbb{H}}(x_{i_n})$$

where the right side is the ordered monomial in $U(S_{\mathbb{H}})$ (product in any parenthesization, since $\mathbb{H}$ is associative). The set of all such ordered monomials with $i_1 \leq \cdots \leq i_n$ is precisely the classical PBW basis $\mathcal{B}_{\text{PBW}}$.

**Surjectivity:** Every PBW basis element $x_{i_1} \cdots x_{i_n}$ is the image of $T_L(x_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_n})$ (left-associated canonical tree) under $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$.

**Compatibility of relations:** The Sabinin bracket relation (R1) projects to the Lie bracket relation $xy - yx = [x,y]$ (since higher Sabinin terms vanish), which is exactly the PBW relation. $\square$

## 23.6 Part (d): Recovery of the Classical Killing Form

**Theorem 23.10.** Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra viewed as a Sabinin algebra $S$ over $\mathbb{O}$ (with trivial higher Sabinin operations). Let $B_\mu(X,Y) = \int_\Omega \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X^{(\omega)} \circ \text{ad}_Y^{(\omega)}) \, d\mu(\omega)$ be the decompactified Killing form. When $\mu = \delta_{\omega_0}$ (point measure concentrated at a single context $\omega_0$):

$$B_{\delta_{\omega_0}}(X, Y) = \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X \circ \text{ad}_Y) = B(X, Y)$$

the classical Killing form.

*Proof.*

**Step 1: The decompactified Killing form.** Recall the definition from Chapter 8. For a Sabinin algebra $S$ over $\mathbb{O}$, the adjoint action is contextual: for each $\omega \in \Omega$, we have a possibly different representation $\text{ad}^{(\omega)}: S \to \text{End}(S)$ defined by:
$$\text{ad}_X^{(\omega)}(Y) = \langle X, Y \rangle_\omega + \sum_{m,n} \Phi_{m,n}^{(\omega)}(X; Y)$$

where the Sabinin operations depend on the context $\omega$. The decompactified Killing form integrates over all contexts:
$$B_\mu(X, Y) = \int_\Omega \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X^{(\omega)} \circ \text{ad}_Y^{(\omega)}) \, d\mu(\omega)$$

**Step 2: Point measure.** When $\mu = \delta_{\omega_0}$:
$$B_{\delta_{\omega_0}}(X, Y) = \int_\Omega \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X^{(\omega)} \circ \text{ad}_Y^{(\omega)}) \, d\delta_{\omega_0}(\omega) = \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X^{(\omega_0)} \circ \text{ad}_Y^{(\omega_0)})$$

**Step 3: Quaternionic restriction.** When $S$ is a Lie algebra (higher Sabinin operations vanish) and we restrict to $\mathbb{H}$-scalars, the contextual adjoint reduces to the standard adjoint:
$$\text{ad}_X^{(\omega_0)}(Y) = \langle X, Y \rangle = [X, Y]$$
for all $\omega_0$ (since there is no context-dependence in a Lie algebra — the bracket is the unique Sabinin operation).

Therefore:
$$B_{\delta_{\omega_0}}(X, Y) = \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X \circ \text{ad}_Y) = B(X, Y)$$

which is the classical Killing form. $\square$

**Corollary 23.11.** For a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, the decompactified Killing form $B_\mu$ is a *generalization* of the classical Killing form in the precise sense that:
1. It reduces to $B$ when $\mu$ is a point measure.
2. It carries strictly more information when $\mu$ is not a point measure: the function $\omega \mapsto \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X^{(\omega)} \circ \text{ad}_Y^{(\omega)})$ records how the "inner product" of $X$ and $Y$ varies across contexts.
3. Non-degeneracy of $B$ (Cartan's criterion for semisimplicity) lifts to a measure-theoretic non-degeneracy of $B_\mu$: if $B_\mu(X, Y) = 0$ for all $Y$ and all sufficiently regular $\mu$, then $X = 0$.

## 23.7 Part (e): Recovery of Classical Vector Calculus Identities

**Theorem 23.12.** All standard vector calculus identities in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are recovered from the 7D octonionic calculus via quaternionic projection. Specifically:

**(e1)** $\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{F}$

**(e2)** $\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G}) = \mathbf{G} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) - \mathbf{F} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{G})$

**(e3)** $\nabla \times (\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G}) = \mathbf{F}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G}) - \mathbf{G}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) + (\mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{F} - (\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{G}$

**(e4)** $\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) = 0$

**(e5)** $\nabla \times (\nabla f) = 0$

*Proof.* We prove this by establishing the 7D analogues and showing they project.

**Step 1: 7D octonionic differential operators.** Define, for $\mathbb{R}^7$-valued fields $\mathbf{F}: \mathbb{R}^7 \to \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$:
$$\text{div}_7(\mathbf{F}) = \sum_{i=1}^{7} \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_i}$$
$$(\text{curl}_7(\mathbf{F}))_k = \sum_{i,j=1}^{7} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_i}$$

where $\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$ is the totally antisymmetric structure tensor of the 7D cross product, defined by $e_i \times_7 e_j = \sum_k \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} e_k$. This tensor has the explicit nonzero values determined by the Fano plane oriented lines:
$$\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} = +1 \text{ for } (i,j,k) \in \{(1,2,3), (1,4,5), (2,4,6), (3,4,7), (1,7,6), (2,5,7), (3,6,5)\}$$
and their cyclic permutations (with antisymmetry).

**Step 2: Restriction to 3D.** When $\mathbf{F}$ depends only on $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and has components only along $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ (i.e., $\mathbf{F}$ is a 3D vector field embedded in 7D), the 7D structure constants $\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$ restrict to the standard 3D Levi-Civita symbol:
$$\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}\big|_{i,j,k \in \{1,2,3\}} = \epsilon_{ijk}$$

This is because the quaternionic subalgebra $\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ has the same multiplication structure as $\{\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}\}$ in $\mathbb{H}$, and the Levi-Civita symbol encodes this.

Therefore:
$$\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(\text{curl}_7(\mathbf{F})) = \nabla \times_3 \mathbf{F}$$
$$\text{div}_7(\mathbf{F})\big|_{\text{3D}} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$$

**Step 3: Identity (e1) — Double curl.**

We derive the 7D double curl identity by direct component computation.

**Step 3a: Component expansion.** By definition of the 7D curl:
$$(\nabla \times \mathbf{F})_k = \sum_{p,q} \epsilon_{pqk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial F_q}{\partial x_p}$$

Applying curl a second time:
$$(\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))_i = \sum_{j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})_k = \sum_{j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \sum_{l,m} \epsilon_{lmk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial F_m}{\partial x_l}$$

Since the structure constants $\epsilon^{(7)}$ are constant (independent of position), we pull the derivative inside:
$$(\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))_i = \sum_{j,k,l,m} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \epsilon_{lmk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial^2 F_m}{\partial x_j \partial x_l}$$

**Step 3b: Apply the contraction identity.** By the structure constant contraction identity (Ch 11, Lemma 11.4a):
$$\sum_{k=1}^{7} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \epsilon_{lmk}^{(7)} = \delta_{il}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{jl} + T_{ijlm}$$

where $T_{ijlm}$ is the Fano correction tensor. Substituting:
$$(\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))_i = \sum_{j,l,m} \left(\delta_{il}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{jl} + T_{ijlm}\right) \frac{\partial^2 F_m}{\partial x_j \partial x_l}$$

**Step 3c: Evaluate each term.**

*First term:* $\displaystyle\sum_{j,l,m} \delta_{il}\delta_{jm} \frac{\partial^2 F_m}{\partial x_j \partial x_l} = \sum_{j} \frac{\partial^2 F_j}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \sum_{j} \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) = (\text{grad}_7(\text{div}_7(\mathbf{F})))_i$.

*Second term:* $\displaystyle\sum_{j,l,m} \delta_{im}\delta_{jl} \frac{\partial^2 F_m}{\partial x_j \partial x_l} = \sum_{j} \frac{\partial^2 F_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} = \nabla^2 F_i = (\Delta_7 \mathbf{F})_i$.

*Third term:* $\displaystyle\sum_{j,l,m} T_{ijlm} \frac{\partial^2 F_m}{\partial x_j \partial x_l} =: \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})_i$.

Combining (note the second term enters with a minus sign):
$$(\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))_i = (\text{grad}_7(\text{div}_7(\mathbf{F})))_i - (\Delta_7 \mathbf{F})_i + \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})_i$$

That is:
$$\text{curl}_7(\text{curl}_7(\mathbf{F})) = \text{grad}_7(\text{div}_7(\mathbf{F})) - \Delta_7 \mathbf{F} + \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})$$

where the *associator correction* is:
$$\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})_i = \sum_{j,l,m} T_{ijlm} \frac{\partial^2 F_m}{\partial x_j \partial x_l}$$

**Step 3d: The correction vanishes on any quaternionic 3-plane.** By property (b) of the Fano correction tensor (Ch 11, Lemma 11.4a): $T_{ijlm} = 0$ whenever all four indices $i, j, l, m$ lie within a single Fano triple $\{a, b, c\}$ (corresponding to a quaternionic subalgebra).

When we restrict to a 3D quaternionic subspace — say indices in $\{1, 2, 3\}$ (the subalgebra $\mathbb{H} = \text{span}\{1, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$) — the field $\mathbf{F}$ has components $F_m$ only for $m \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, depending only on $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, and the correction becomes:
$$\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})_i\big|_{\text{3D}} = \sum_{\substack{j, l, m \in \{1,2,3\}}} T_{ijlm} \frac{\partial^2 F_m}{\partial x_j \partial x_l}$$

Since $i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $j, l, m \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, all four indices lie within the Fano triple $(1, 2, 3)$. By property (b) of $T$, every such $T_{ijlm} = 0$.

The reason property (b) holds is elementary: within the Fano triple $\{1, 2, 3\}$, there are only 3 distinct index values available for the 4 slots of $T_{ijlm}$, so at least two indices must coincide. If $i = j$, then $T_{ijlm} = T_{iilm} = 0$ by the antisymmetry $T_{ijlm} = -T_{jilm}$. Similarly if $l = m$. The only remaining case is $\{i, j\} = \{l, m\}$ (as sets), but then either $(i,j) = (l,m)$ giving $\sum_k \epsilon_{ijk}\epsilon_{lmk} = \sum_k \epsilon_{ijk}^2 = 1$ and $\delta_{il}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{jl} = 1$, hence $T = 0$; or $(i,j) = (m,l)$ giving $T_{ijml} = 0$ by the same argument with reversed sign.

Therefore $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})|_{\text{3D}} = 0$, and the 7D identity reduces to the classical:
$$\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{F}$$

**Step 4: Identity (e4).** In 7D:
$$\text{div}_7(\text{curl}_7(\mathbf{F})) = \sum_{i,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial^2 F_j}{\partial x_i \partial x_k}$$

By the antisymmetry of $\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$ and the symmetry of partial derivatives ($\partial_i \partial_k = \partial_k \partial_i$):
$$\sum_{i,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial^2 F_j}{\partial x_i \partial x_k} = 0$$

This holds in ANY dimension where the cross product structure constants are totally antisymmetric — it does not require associativity. Therefore $\text{div}_7(\text{curl}_7(\mathbf{F})) = 0$ holds in 7D, and its 3D projection is $\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) = 0$.

**Step 5: Identity (e5).** Similarly:
$$(\text{curl}_7(\text{grad}_7(f)))_k = \sum_{i,j} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = 0$$

by antisymmetry of $\epsilon$ and symmetry of mixed partials. This holds in 7D and projects to $\nabla \times (\nabla f) = 0$.

**Step 6: Identity (e2) — Divergence of cross product.**

We prove that this identity holds in 7D *exactly*, without any correction term, and therefore its 3D restriction is immediate.

**Step 6a: The scalar triple product.** Before addressing the divergence identity, we establish the cyclic symmetry of the scalar triple product in 7D. For $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^7$, define:
$$[\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}] := \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times_7 \mathbf{c}) = \sum_{i,j,k} a_i \epsilon_{jki}^{(7)} b_j c_k$$

Using the total antisymmetry of $\epsilon_{jki}^{(7)}$ (which holds because the 7D structure constants are totally antisymmetric — this is a defining property of the 7D cross product, see Ch 4):
$$\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times_7 \mathbf{c}) = \sum_{i,j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} a_i b_j c_k$$

where in the last step we used cyclic symmetry: $\epsilon_{jki}^{(7)} = \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$. Now consider $\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times_7 \mathbf{a})$:
$$\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times_7 \mathbf{a}) = \sum_{i,j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} b_i c_j a_k$$

Relabeling dummy indices $i \to k, j \to i, k \to j$:
$$= \sum_{i,j,k} \epsilon_{kij}^{(7)} b_k c_i a_j = \sum_{i,j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} a_j b_k c_i$$

Relabeling again $i \to k, j \to i, k \to j$:
$$= \sum_{i,j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} a_i b_j c_k = \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times_7 \mathbf{c})$$

The same argument gives $\mathbf{c} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times_7 \mathbf{b}) = \sum_{i,j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} a_i b_j c_k$. Therefore:
$$\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times_7 \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times_7 \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{c} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times_7 \mathbf{b})$$

This cyclic symmetry is exact in 7D; no associator correction is needed, because it depends only on the total antisymmetry of $\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$ (a single $\epsilon$ factor, no contraction).

**Step 6b: The divergence identity in 7D.** As proved in Ch 11, Theorem 11.10, the identity:
$$\text{div}_7(\mathbf{F} \times_7 \mathbf{G}) = \mathbf{G} \cdot \text{curl}_7(\mathbf{F}) - \mathbf{F} \cdot \text{curl}_7(\mathbf{G})$$

holds *exactly* in 7D, without any correction term. The proof (given in full in Ch 11) uses only the Leibniz rule, the antisymmetry $\epsilon_{jki}^{(7)} = -\epsilon_{kji}^{(7)}$, and the cyclic symmetry $\epsilon_{jki}^{(7)} = \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$. At no point does a contraction $\sum_k \epsilon_{ijk}\epsilon_{lmk}$ appear, so the Fano correction tensor $T_{ijlm}$ never enters.

Since the 7D identity is already the same as the 3D identity (no correction), the 3D restriction is trivially exact. $\square_{(\text{e2})}$

**Step 7: Identity (e3) — Curl of a cross product (BAC-CAB recovery).**

**Step 7a: The 7D curl-of-cross-product identity.** We compute $(\nabla \times (\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G}))_i$ in components. We have:
$$(\mathbf{F} \times_7 \mathbf{G})_k = \sum_{p,q} \epsilon_{pqk}^{(7)} F_p G_q$$

Taking the curl:
$$(\nabla \times (\mathbf{F} \times_7 \mathbf{G}))_i = \sum_{j,k} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left(\sum_{p,q} \epsilon_{pqk}^{(7)} F_p G_q\right)$$

$$= \sum_{j,k,p,q} \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \epsilon_{pqk}^{(7)} \left(\frac{\partial F_p}{\partial x_j} G_q + F_p \frac{\partial G_q}{\partial x_j}\right)$$

Apply the contraction identity $\sum_k \epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)} \epsilon_{pqk}^{(7)} = \delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} - \delta_{iq}\delta_{jp} + T_{ijpq}$:

$$= \sum_{j,p,q} \left(\delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} - \delta_{iq}\delta_{jp} + T_{ijpq}\right) \left(\frac{\partial F_p}{\partial x_j} G_q + F_p \frac{\partial G_q}{\partial x_j}\right)$$

**Step 7b: Evaluate the Kronecker-delta terms.**

*Term* $\delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} \frac{\partial F_p}{\partial x_j} G_q$: summing gives $\sum_j \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j} G_j = (\mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla) F_i$.

*Term* $\delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} F_p \frac{\partial G_q}{\partial x_j}$: summing gives $F_i \sum_j \frac{\partial G_j}{\partial x_j} = F_i (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G})$.

*Term* $-\delta_{iq}\delta_{jp} \frac{\partial F_p}{\partial x_j} G_q$: summing gives $-G_i \sum_j \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} = -G_i (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F})$.

*Term* $-\delta_{iq}\delta_{jp} F_p \frac{\partial G_q}{\partial x_j}$: summing gives $-\sum_j F_j \frac{\partial G_i}{\partial x_j} = -(\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla) G_i$.

Combining the four Kronecker-delta contributions:
$$(\mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla) F_i + F_i (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G}) - G_i (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) - (\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla) G_i$$

which is the classical identity $\mathbf{F}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G}) - \mathbf{G}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) + (\mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{F} - (\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{G}$ (component $i$).

**Step 7c: The Fano correction.** The remaining contribution from $T_{ijpq}$ is:
$$\mathcal{A}'(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G})_i = \sum_{j,p,q} T_{ijpq} \left(\frac{\partial F_p}{\partial x_j} G_q + F_p \frac{\partial G_q}{\partial x_j}\right)$$

So the full 7D identity is:
$$\nabla \times (\mathbf{F} \times_7 \mathbf{G}) = \mathbf{F}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G}) - \mathbf{G}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) + (\mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{F} - (\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{G} + \mathcal{A}'(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G})$$

**Step 7d: The correction vanishes on quaternionic 3-planes.** When all indices are restricted to a quaternionic triple (say $\{1, 2, 3\}$), we have $i, j, p, q \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. By property (b) of the Fano correction tensor (Ch 11, Lemma 11.4a), $T_{ijpq} = 0$ whenever all four indices lie in a single Fano triple. The reasoning is exactly as in Step 3d: with only 3 distinct values available for 4 indices, at least two must coincide, and the antisymmetry $T_{ijpq} = -T_{jipq} = -T_{ijqp}$ then forces $T_{ijpq} = 0$.

Therefore $\mathcal{A}'(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G})|_{\text{3D}} = 0$, and the 7D identity reduces to the classical:
$$\nabla \times (\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G}) = \mathbf{F}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G}) - \mathbf{G}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) + (\mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{F} - (\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{G}$$

$\square$

**Remark 23.13** (What is new in 7D). The identities (e1), (e3) acquire genuinely new structure in 7D that has no 3D analogue:

- **Double curl (e1):** The correction $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})_i = \sum_{j,l,m} T_{ijlm} \partial_j \partial_l F_m$ is nonzero in 7D whenever the field $\mathbf{F}$ has components or spatial variation outside a single quaternionic 3-plane. This correction arises from the 21 nonzero entries of the Fano tensor $T_{ijlm}$ (Ch 11, Theorem 11.10) and encodes the failure of the Jacobi identity for the 7D cross product. Physically, it represents additional coupling between field components belonging to different quaternionic subalgebras.

- **Curl of cross product (e3):** The correction $\mathcal{A}'(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G})_i = \sum_{j,p,q} T_{ijpq}(\partial_j F_p G_q + F_p \partial_j G_q)$ is similarly nonzero in the general 7D setting and vanishes only upon quaternionic restriction.

- **Divergence of cross product (e2):** This identity holds *exactly* in 7D with NO correction. The reason is structural: the proof uses only a single factor of $\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$ (no contraction of two epsilon tensors), so the Fano tensor $T$ never appears.

- **Identities (e4) and (e5):** These hold exactly in all dimensions where the cross product structure constants are totally antisymmetric. The proofs use only antisymmetry of $\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$ and symmetry of mixed partial derivatives — properties that are dimension-independent.

## 23.9 The Master Recovery Principle

**Theorem 23.14** (Master Recovery Principle). Let $\mathbb{H} \subset \mathbb{O}$ be a quaternionic subalgebra. Every identity and structure in the COA (Contextual Octonionic Algebra) framework that is built from the following five classes of operations:

(I) the octonionic product and its derived operations (cross product, dot product, conjugation),
(II) $G_2$-equivariant group actions,
(III) the COPBW basis construction,
(IV) the decompactified Killing form,
(V) the differential operators (gradient, divergence, curl),

when restricted to the quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H}$ (with the simultaneous specializations listed below), reduces to the corresponding classical 3D/4D structure.

The required specializations are:
- Restrict all octonionic elements to $\mathbb{H}$ (so the cross product, dot product, and conjugation act within $\mathbb{H}$).
- Restrict the symmetry group from $G_2$ to $SU(2) \subset SU(3) \subset G_2$.
- Collapse all COPBW tree shapes to a single parenthesization (which is unambiguous because $\mathbb{H}$ is associative).
- Specialize the context measure $\mu$ to a point measure $\delta_{\omega_0}$.
- Restrict all vector field components and spatial variables to $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H}) \cong \mathbb{R}^3$.

**Proof.** This theorem is the logical conjunction of the individual recovery theorems proved earlier in this chapter. We verify that each of the five operation classes recovers its classical counterpart, and then observe that the recovery of any composite structure follows by induction on the number of operations.

**Claim 1: Each individual operation class recovers its classical counterpart.** This has been established by the following individual theorems:

| Operation class | Recovery theorem | What it proves |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| (I) Cross product, dot product | Theorem 23.5, Corollary 23.6 | $\pi_{\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})}(u \times_7 v) = u \times_3 v$ for $u, v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ |
| (II) $G_2$ group action | Theorem 23.8 | $G_2 \supset SU(3) \supset SU(2) \to SO(3)$; the $SU(2)$ action on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ is the classical rotation action |
| (III) COPBW basis | Theorem 23.9 | COPBW tree monomials project to PBW ordered monomials |
| (IV) Decompactified Killing form | Theorem 23.10 | $B_{\delta_{\omega_0}}(X,Y) = B(X,Y)$ (classical Killing form) |
| (V) Differential operators | Theorem 23.12 | All five vector calculus identities (e1)-(e5) are recovered; associator corrections vanish on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ |

**Claim 2: Recovery is preserved under composition.** Any structure $\mathcal{F}$ built from classes (I)-(V) is a finite composition of operations from these classes. We argue by induction on the number $n$ of operations used.

*Base case ($n = 1$):* A single operation from one of the five classes recovers its classical counterpart by the theorems listed above.

*Inductive step:* Suppose $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{O} \circ \mathcal{G}$, where $\mathcal{G}$ involves $n-1$ operations (and recovers its classical counterpart by the inductive hypothesis) and $\mathcal{O}$ is a single operation from one of the five classes. The key property enabling the induction is that each recovery theorem shows recovery for *arbitrary inputs from the restricted domain*, not just for specific inputs. Precisely:

- *Class (I):* Theorem 23.5 shows that $u \times_7 v = u \times_3 v$ whenever $u, v \in \text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$. If $u$ and $v$ are themselves outputs of earlier operations that, by the inductive hypothesis, lie in $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ and agree with their classical counterparts, then $u \times_7 v$ agrees with $u \times_3 v$.

- *Class (II):* The $SU(2)$ action preserves $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ (Theorem 23.8, Step 4), so applying an $SU(2)$ rotation to a vector already in $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ produces a vector in $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$, and the action is the classical $SO(3)$ rotation.

- *Class (V):* The differential operators $\nabla$, $\nabla \cdot$, $\nabla \times$ applied to fields valued in $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ depending on $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ produce outputs in $\text{Im}(\mathbb{H})$ (or $\mathbb{R}$ for divergence). The associator corrections vanish because all indices remain within the quaternionic triple (Step 3d and Step 7d of Theorem 23.12).

- *Classes (III) and (IV):* The COPBW basis and Killing form operate on algebraic structures (Sabinin algebras), not on individual vectors. Their recovery (Theorems 23.9 and 23.10) depends on the vanishing of higher Sabinin operations and the point-measure specialization, both of which are structural properties that hold independently of the specific elements involved.

Therefore, by induction, any finite composition of operations from classes (I)-(V), when restricted to the quaternionic subalgebra with the specified specializations, recovers the corresponding classical structure.

**Remark on scope.** This theorem is not a single deep result but rather the systematic conjunction of Theorems 23.5, 23.8, 23.9, 23.10, and 23.12. Its content is that the individual recovery results are *mutually compatible* — restricting to $\mathbb{H}$ for one operation does not interfere with the restriction for another. This compatibility holds because the restriction is a single linear projection $\pi_{\mathbb{H}}$, applied uniformly to all operations. $\square$

## 23.10 Formalization Notes

All five parts of the 3D Recovery Theorem have been proved with full rigor:

- **Part (a)**: Complete. The computation is explicit and uses only the Fano plane multiplication table (Theorem 23.5).
- **Part (b)**: Complete. The subgroup chain $G_2 \supset SU(3) \supset SU(2)$ is well-established in the literature (Bryant, 1987; Harvey, 1990) and the stabilizer computation is given explicitly (Theorem 23.8).
- **Part (c)**: Complete. Uses the COPBW theorem (Chapter 22) and Artin's theorem (Theorem 23.9).
- **Part (d)**: Complete. The point measure specialization is immediate from the definition of integration against a delta measure (Theorem 23.10).
- **Part (e)**: Complete for all five identities (Theorem 23.12):
  - (e1) Double curl: derived from the structure constant contraction identity $\sum_k \epsilon_{ijk}\epsilon_{lmk} = \delta_{il}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{jl} + T_{ijlm}$ (Lemma 11.4a). The correction $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{F})_i = \sum_{j,l,m} T_{ijlm} \partial_j \partial_l F_m$ is computed explicitly and shown to vanish on quaternionic 3-planes because $T_{ijlm} = 0$ within any Fano triple.
  - (e2) Divergence of cross product: holds *exactly* in 7D (no correction term), proved using only the antisymmetry and cyclic symmetry of $\epsilon_{ijk}^{(7)}$. The scalar triple product cyclic symmetry $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{c} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})$ is also exact in 7D.
  - (e3) Curl of cross product (BAC-CAB): derived from the same contraction identity. The correction $\mathcal{A}'(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G})_i = \sum_{j,p,q} T_{ijpq}(\partial_j F_p G_q + F_p \partial_j G_q)$ vanishes on quaternionic 3-planes by the same pigeonhole argument on $T$.
  - (e4) $\text{div}(\text{curl}) = 0$: exact in all dimensions by antisymmetry of $\epsilon$ and symmetry of mixed partials.
  - (e5) $\text{curl}(\text{grad}) = 0$: exact in all dimensions by the same reasoning.
- **Master Recovery Principle** (Theorem 23.14): Established as the logical conjunction of Theorems 23.5, 23.8, 23.9, 23.10, and 23.12, with compositionality verified by induction on the number of operations.
