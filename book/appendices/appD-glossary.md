## D.1 Terms

### Akivis Algebra
A vector space equipped with a bilinear antisymmetric bracket $[x,y]$ and a trilinear operation $(x,y,z)$ (the "associator bracket") satisfying the **Akivis identity**: the Jacobi defect equals a specific combination of associator brackets. Akivis algebras are the tangent algebras of local analytic loops, generalizing Lie algebras (which are the tangent algebras of Lie groups). Every alternative algebra generates an Akivis algebra. **Ch. 9.**

### Alternativity
The property that the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative. Equivalently: $x(xy) = (xx)y$ (left alternative), $(yx)x = y(xx)$ (right alternative), and $x(yx) = (xy)x$ (flexible). The octonions are the largest normed division algebra satisfying alternativity. Alternativity is the "residual associativity" that survives after full associativity is lost. **Ch. 3.**

### Associative Calibration
See **Coassociative Calibration**.

### Associator
The trilinear map $[a, b, c] = (ab)c - a(bc)$ measuring the failure of associativity. In the octonionic framework, the associator is not an error term but the fundamental carrier of **contextual information**. It is completely antisymmetric in $\mathbb{O}$ and vanishes if and only if $a, b, c$ lie in a common quaternionic subalgebra. The associator is a $G_2$-equivariant map $\Lambda^3(\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})) \to \text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$. **Ch. 3, 7.**

### Associator Completeness
The theorem (Ch. 25) that the set of all associators $\{[a,b,c] : a,b,c \in \mathbb{O}\}$ spans $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ and that the associator encodes ALL contextual information about composition order in the octonionic algebra. Formally: two compositions of the same elements are equal if and only if their associators agree.

### Cayley-Dickson Construction
The uniform doubling procedure that produces each normed division algebra from the previous: $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{O}$. Given an algebra $A$ with conjugation, define $A' = A \oplus A$ with multiplication $(a,b)(c,d) = (ac - \bar{d}b, da + b\bar{c})$. Fails to produce a division algebra beyond $\mathbb{O}$ (the sedenions have zero divisors). **Ch. 2.**

### COA (Contextual Octonionic Algebra)
The axiomatic system introduced in Chapter 6 that provides the logical foundation for all results in this book. The COA axioms extend the octonion algebra axioms with:
1. The **Contextual Composition Axiom**: every composition carries an associator context.
2. The **Decompactification Axiom**: the Killing form extends to uncountable measure spaces.
3. The **Projection Axiom**: every COA result projects to a valid classical result.
4. The **Coherence Axiom**: the total associator content is conserved under admissible transformations.
**Ch. 6.**

### Coassociative Calibration
A 4-form $*\phi$ on a 7-manifold with $G_2$ structure, dual to the **associative 3-form** $\phi$. A 4-dimensional submanifold is coassociative if and only if it is calibrated by $*\phi$. **Ch. 5, 31.**

### Coherence Conservation
The new conservation law (Ch. 18): in any closed octonionic system, the total **coherence integral** $\int |\text{Assoc}(a,b,c)|^2 d\mu$ is conserved under time evolution. This is the non-associative analog of energy conservation. When projected to the associative (quaternionic) subalgebra, it reduces to standard energy conservation.

### Composition Algebra
An algebra $A$ over $\mathbb{R}$ with a multiplicative norm: $|ab| = |a||b|$ for all $a, b \in A$. By Hurwitz's theorem, the only composition division algebras are $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$. **Ch. 1.**

### Contextual Arity
In the operadic framework (Ch. 14), an operation's arity is not a fixed integer but a **context-dependent** quantity. An operation that is binary in one context may be effectively ternary in another, depending on the associator structure. Formally: the arity of an operation $\mu$ in context $\omega$ is the rank of the operadic tree representing $\mu$ after contextualization by $\omega$.

### Contextual Charge
A generalization of conserved charges (electric charge, color charge, etc.) to the non-associative setting. An octonionic charge multiplet lives in a representation of $G_2$ rather than $\text{SU}(3) \times \text{SU}(2) \times \text{U}(1)$. The projection to any quaternionic subalgebra recovers the corresponding Standard Model charge. **Ch. 19.**

### Contextual Charge Conservation
The principle that octonionic charge multiplets are conserved under $G_2$-equivariant dynamics. This unifies color charge conservation and electroweak charge conservation as projections of a single octonionic conservation law. **Ch. 19.**

### COPBW (Contextual Octonionic Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt)
The generalization of the PBW theorem to non-associative universal enveloping algebras. The COPBW theorem (Ch. 22) states that $U_{\mathbb{O}}(S)$ admits a basis of **tree monomials** -- operadic trees where the branching structure encodes the association order. The classical PBW basis is recovered when the underlying algebra is restricted to an associative subalgebra. **Ch. 9, 10, 22.**

### Cross Product (7-dimensional)
The unique (up to sign and $G_2$ action) bilinear antisymmetric product on $\mathbb{R}^7$ satisfying $|a \times b|^2 = |a|^2|b|^2 - (a \cdot b)^2$ and $a \cdot (a \times b) = 0$. Defined by $a \times b = \text{Im}(\tilde{a}\tilde{b})$ where $\tilde{a}, \tilde{b}$ are the imaginary octonions corresponding to $a, b$. Exists only in dimensions 0, 1, 3, and 7. Does NOT satisfy the Jacobi identity (this is a feature, not a bug). **Ch. 4.**

### Decompactified Killing Form
The extension of the classical Killing form $B(X,Y) = \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X \circ \text{ad}_Y)$ to a measure-theoretic integral:
$$B_\mu(X,Y) = \int_\Omega \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X^{(\omega)} \circ \text{ad}_Y^{(\omega)}) \, d\mu(\omega)$$
where $\Omega$ is a measure space of contexts and $\text{ad}^{(\omega)}$ is the adjoint representation in context $\omega$. Reduces to the classical Killing form when $\mu = \delta$ (point mass at a single context). Allows uncountable-dimensional representation spaces. **Ch. 8.**

### Derivation (of $\mathbb{O}$)
A linear map $D: \mathbb{O} \to \mathbb{O}$ satisfying the Leibniz rule: $D(xy) = D(x)y + xD(y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{O}$. The derivations of $\mathbb{O}$ form the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2 = \text{Der}(\mathbb{O})$, which is 14-dimensional. **Ch. 5.**

### Fano Plane
The smallest finite projective plane $\mathbb{F}_2 P^2$, with 7 points and 7 lines, 3 points on each line, 3 lines through each point. It encodes the multiplication table of the imaginary octonions: each oriented line $(e_i, e_j, e_k)$ specifies $e_i e_j = e_k$. **Ch. 2, Appendix A.**

### Flexible Identity
$(xy)x = x(yx)$ for all $x, y$. Holds in all alternative algebras, including $\mathbb{O}$. **Ch. 3.**

### $G_2$
The smallest exceptional simple Lie group. $G_2 = \text{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$, the automorphism group of the octonion algebra. Dimension 14, rank 2. Contains $\text{SU}(3)$ as a maximal subgroup. Acts on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \mathbb{R}^7$. The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ consists of derivations of $\mathbb{O}$. **Ch. 5, Appendix B.**

### $G_2$ Holonomy
A Riemannian 7-manifold $M$ has holonomy contained in $G_2$ if and only if it admits a torsion-free $G_2$-structure, equivalently a parallel 3-form $\phi$. Such manifolds are Ricci-flat. In M-theory, compactification on $G_2$-holonomy manifolds yields $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY in 4D. **Ch. 5, 31.**

### $G_2$ Unification Theorem
The theorem (Ch. 24) proving that the Standard Model gauge group $\text{SU}(3) \times \text{SU}(2) \times \text{U}(1)$ embeds naturally in $G_2$ via the octonionic structure, with the branching $\mathbf{7} \to \mathbf{3} \oplus \bar{\mathbf{3}} \oplus \mathbf{1}$ under $\text{SU}(3)$ providing the quark color representation.

### Hierarchy Invariance Principle
The meta-principle (Ch. 20) that physical laws and conservation principles are invariant under changes of hierarchical decomposition. That is: if a system can be decomposed as $(A \cdot B) \cdot C$ or $A \cdot (B \cdot C)$, the total conserved quantities are the same even though the intermediate values differ. The associator represents the "gauge freedom" of hierarchical decomposition.

### Hopf Fibration
A fiber bundle of spheres over spheres: $S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$, $S^3 \to S^7 \to S^4$, $S^7 \to S^{15} \to S^8$, arising from the projective lines over $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ respectively. The octonionic Hopf fibration $S^7 \to S^{15} \to S^8$ is the largest and is intimately connected to $G_2$ and the exceptional structures. **Ch. 1.**

### Hurwitz's Theorem
The classification theorem: the only normed division algebras over $\mathbb{R}$ are $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$, of dimensions 1, 2, 4, 8. **Ch. 1.**

### Interderivability
The property that any expression in the octonionic framework can be derived from any other through a finite chain of octonionic operations. Formally: for any two elements $a, b \in U_{\mathbb{O}}(S)$, there exists a finite sequence of operations connecting $a$ to $b$ through the universal enveloping algebra. **Ch. 27.**

### Interderivability Theorem
The theorem (Ch. 27) proving interderivability for the non-associative universal enveloping algebra $U_{\mathbb{O}}(S)$. The proof uses the COPBW basis and the connectedness of the operadic tree space.

### Malcev Algebra
A non-associative algebra satisfying the **Malcev identity**: $J(x,y,[x,z]) = [J(x,y,z),x]$ where $J$ is the Jacobiator $J(x,y,z) = [[x,y],z] + [[y,z],x] + [[z,x],y]$. The imaginary octonions $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ with the commutator bracket form a Malcev algebra. Malcev algebras are to Moufang loops as Lie algebras are to Lie groups. **Ch. 9.**

### Moufang Identity
Three identities satisfied by alternative algebras: (1) $((xy)z)y = x(y(zy))$, (2) $(x(yz))x = (xy)(zx)$, (3) $((xy)x)z = x(y(xz))$. These are the strongest "partial associativity" conditions that hold in $\mathbb{O}$. **Ch. 3.**

### Moufang Loop
A loop (quasigroup with identity) satisfying the Moufang identities. The unit octonions $S^7$ form a Moufang loop under multiplication. Moufang loops are to non-associative algebra as groups are to associative algebra. **Ch. 3.**

### Non-Gameable Alignment
A property of optimization problems over non-associative compositions: no strategic agent can improve their outcome by re-bracketing the composition of inputs, because the associator ensures every re-bracketing changes the result in a detectable way. **Ch. 26, 35.**

### Non-Gameable Alignment Theorem
The theorem (Ch. 26) proving that optimization over octonionic compositions is non-gameable: there exists no re-bracketing strategy that improves one stakeholder's outcome without affecting others, assuming the associator is nonzero on the relevant triples.

### Normed Division Algebra
An algebra $A$ over $\mathbb{R}$ that is both a division algebra ($ax = b$ always solvable for $a \neq 0$) and has a multiplicative norm ($|ab| = |a||b|$). By Hurwitz's theorem: only $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$. **Ch. 1.**

### Octonionic Calculus
The extension of vector calculus to 7 dimensions using the octonionic structure. Includes: 7D gradient ($\nabla f = \sum_{i=1}^{7} (\partial f/\partial x_i) e_i$), 7D divergence ($\nabla \cdot F = \sum_i \partial F_i/\partial x_i$), 7D curl ($(\nabla \times F)_k = \sum_{i,j} f_{ijk} \partial F_j/\partial x_i$), and the 7D Laplacian. The 7D curl uses the octonion structure constants $f_{ijk}$. **Ch. 11.**

### Octonionic Charge Multiplet
An element of a $G_2$ representation that encodes all conserved charges of a particle/system. The 7-dimensional fundamental representation contains the "full charge" which projects to color ($\text{SU}(3)$), weak ($\text{SU}(2)$), and hypercharge ($\text{U}(1)$) under the appropriate branching. **Ch. 19.**

### Octonionic Differential Equation
A differential equation where the unknown function and/or operators are octonion-valued. Due to non-associativity, the operator ordering matters, and the solution theory is richer than for quaternionic or complex equations. **Ch. 12.**

### Power-Associativity
The property that $x^n$ is unambiguously defined for all $n$ (all bracketings of $x \cdot x \cdots x$ give the same result). The octonions are power-associative. **Ch. 3.**

### Projection Principle
The methodological principle that every result in the 7D octonionic framework must project down to the corresponding classical 3D/4D result when restricted to a quaternionic subalgebra. This ensures backward compatibility: nothing valid in classical mathematics is lost. **Ch. 6, 15.**

### Quaternionic Slice
A quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H}_i \subset \mathbb{O}$ (one of 7, determined by a Fano line). Restricting all octonionic operations to a quaternionic slice recovers classical 3D/4D mathematics. **Ch. 15.**

### Sabinin Algebra
The most general tangent algebra of a local analytic loop, generalizing both Lie algebras and Malcev algebras. A Sabinin algebra has multilinear operations of all arities satisfying universal identities. The COPBW theorem is formulated for Sabinin algebras over $\mathbb{O}$. **Ch. 9.**

### Sedenions
The 16-dimensional algebra $\mathbb{S} = \text{CD}(\mathbb{O})$ obtained by applying Cayley-Dickson to the octonions. Contains zero divisors and is therefore NOT a division algebra. The sedenions are the first Cayley-Dickson algebra that fails to be a composition algebra. **Ch. 1.**

### Tree Monomial
An element of the COPBW basis, represented as a planar rooted binary tree whose leaves are labeled by generators. The tree shape encodes the association structure. For example, the tree monomials $((a \cdot b) \cdot c)$ and $(a \cdot (b \cdot c))$ are distinct basis elements, and their difference is the associator $[a,b,c]$. **Ch. 10, 22.**

### Tree-Monomial Basis
The COPBW basis for $U_{\mathbb{O}}(S)$, consisting of tree monomials. In the associative limit, all trees of the same ordered leaf sequence are identified (by setting associators to zero), recovering the classical PBW basis. **Ch. 10, 22.**
