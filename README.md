# The Octonionic Rewrite

**A Complete Mathematical Framework for Unified Systems**

A 42-chapter book establishing a new field of mathematics rooted in 7D octonionic non-associative algebra. The framework recovers all existing 3D/4D physics as projections, resolves anomalies where associative mathematics fails, and extends mathematical expressiveness to contextual, hierarchical systems.

The central insight: the associator $[a,b,c] = (ab)c - a(bc)$ is not an error term. It is information.

## Rigor Levels

Every chapter carries an honest assessment:

- **Rigorous** -- Complete proofs, verified computations
- **Constructive** -- Real mathematical structure, some steps sketched with clear paths to completion
- **Speculative** -- Interesting ideas, not yet proven or empirically validated
- **Expository** -- Synthesizes known mathematics, no novelty claimed
